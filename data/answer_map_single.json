    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Gas prices were WAY higher in 2008, under REPUBLICAN president George W. Bush\" is partially true. According to the evidence, the highest gas prices in the past 20 years did occur in July 2008, during the Bush administration, with prices reaching around $4.11 per gallon. However, the claim is also misleading because it does not provide the full context of the situation. The evidence shows that gas prices were also low during the Bush administration, particularly after the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. Additionally, the claim implies that the president has a direct impact on gas prices, which is not supported by the evidence. The price of gasoline is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including the state of the economy, global supply and demand, and OPEC's production decisions. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate but also misleading and oversimplifies the complex factors that affect gas prices."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that if you don't comply with getting a COVID-19 vaccination and you're on Social Security or disability, you won't be able to receive your money. However, the evidence provided shows that there is no such vaccination requirement in place and no proposed legislation that ties Social Security benefits to vaccination status. The claim is based on a misleading interpretation of a Senate floor discussion, where Senator Rick Scott introduced a bill to prohibit requiring vaccination as a condition of receiving Social Security benefits, but there is no actual policy or law that would result in the loss of benefits for non-compliance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that N.C. Attorney General Josh Stein has gone after Jan. 6 protesters but has \"said nothing\" about violent summer protests in North Carolina and was \"derelict in his duty.\" While it is true that Stein did not prosecute the Jan. 6 protesters, as it is a federal case, the claim is partially false because Stein did take action in response to the Jan. 6 insurrection. He invited the public to report information and referred tips to the FBI. Additionally, Stein signed a letter with other attorneys general to repair the damage done to institutions and build a more perfect union. On the other hand, the claim is partially true because Stein did not publicly speak out or prosecute those involved in the violent summer protests in North Carolina. However, it is important to note that the claim is also misleading because it implies that Stein has not taken any action at all regarding the summer protests, which is not accurate. Stein's office referred tips to the FBI, and he did make a statement condemning the actions of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists."

Specifically, the map splits Pulaski County, which is the largest county in the state and has a diverse population, into three different congressional districts. This is a departure from past practice and has been criticized by political analysts and even the state's Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, who expressed concerns about the impact on minority populations. The map also appears to have been designed to dilute the impact of the minority vote in the 2nd district, which was previously a somewhat competitive seat. Overall, the evidence suggests that the map is a gerrymander that does not prioritize keeping communities together."

While the Justice Department has taken steps to address threats against school officials, including the creation of a task force and the involvement of the National Security Division, there is no evidence that the Patriot Act is being used to label parents as domestic terrorists. The evidence suggests that the Justice Department is focusing on threats of violence or intimidation, which is a different legal standard than domestic terrorism. Additionally, the Justice Department has stated that it would not use the Patriot Act in this context, and experts have noted that the law is not relevant to the issue at hand. However, the claim is also partially true in that some lawmakers, such as Rep. Steve Chabot, have made statements suggesting that the Justice Department is using the Patriot Act to target parents who are exercising their First Amendment rights.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Democrats are \"asking for a blank check book to spend as much as they want without worrying about the repercussions\" is partially true. While it is true that Democrats have proposed increasing the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, the notion that this is a \"blank check\" is a misconception. According to Iowa State University economics professor Joydeep Bhattacharya, the debt ceiling is the limit on how much the U.S. government can spend before getting authorization to spend again, and raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending. Instead, it allows for the government to continue spending on programs that have already been authorized. Additionally, new spending proposals must still go through Congress. Therefore, while Democrats are seeking to increase the debt ceiling to allow for continued spending, it is not a \"blank check\" that allows them to spend as much as they want without repercussions."

While Florida did gain 84,500 jobs in September, the claim exaggerates the proportion of jobs gained by Florida. According to the evidence, Florida accounted for 43.8% of the nation's job growth, not almost half as claimed by DeSantis. Additionally, the evidence notes that the comparison between Florida's job growth and the nation's is not entirely apples-to-apples due to differences in how the numbers are calculated."

While it is true that the Department of Justice has formed a task force to examine how federal enforcement tools could be used to prosecute violent threats and crimes directed at school district personnel, the evidence does not suggest that the FBI is targeting parents who speak out against critical race theory specifically. The memo from the Department of Justice does not mention critical race theory, and the threats mentioned in the National School Boards Association's letter were not limited to those who spoke out against critical race theory. Additionally, the FBI is not targeting parents who engage in \"spirited debate\" or peaceful protests, but rather those who make violent threats or engage in criminal conduct. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in that the Department of Justice is taking action to address violent threats and crimes, but it is misleading in its implication that the FBI is targeting parents who speak out against critical race theory."

The evidence also points to other factors such as a shortage of truckers, warehouse workers, and base materials, as well as congestion at the ports, ships waiting to be unloaded, and a lack of warehouse space, which contribute to the supply chain problems.

While it is true that North Carolina's gas prices increased 14 cents per gallon between Oct. 17 and Oct. 24, according to GasBuddy.com, it is not necessarily the highest in the nation. AAA's data shows that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline had risen six cents since Oct. 18 to hit $3.38 for a gallon of unleaded, and North Carolina's price increase was not the highest among the states tracked by AAA.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that booster shots are not a legitimate or effective way to extend the protection provided by vaccines. In reality, booster shots are a standard part of many vaccination schedules, including for diseases such as tetanus, and are designed to maintain immunity and prevent the spread of disease.

The analysis was specific to a campaign promise by Joe Biden to ban oil and gas operations on federal lands and water, which was not implemented. However, the actual pause on leasing was brief due to a federal court order, and current oil and gas production was not impacted. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that residential non-renewable energy expenditures will increase by $18 billion (in 2020 dollars) from $247 billion to $265 billion, which is close to the $19 billion figure mentioned in the claim.

The evidence provided by Rep.

However, the claim does not account for the fact that not all low-wage workers are single and childless. The evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Christopher Wimer, senior research scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Poverty & Social Policy, suggests that single workers are more likely to earn the federal minimum wage or less, but it does not provide a comprehensive picture of all low-wage workers, including those with children.

While it is true that Fairfax County is not requiring the last four digits of Social Security Numbers on actual absentee ballots, the claim is half-true because the lawsuit in question was about absentee ballot applications, not absentee ballots. The lawsuit was about whether the county was correctly requiring the last four digits of Social Security Numbers on absentee ballot applications, not the actual ballots themselves.

Experts on election administration have criticized the group's methodology, pointing out that the canvassers visited residences up to a year after the election, which would have resulted in inaccurate information, and that the group did not explain how they chose the counties and areas they canvassed.

The claim states that those who served in the military before 2002 get an additional $1,200 a year ($100 per month) in Social Security, but this is not accurate. According to the evidence, the amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and which years the person was in the military. Additionally, the claim states that one must ask for the benefit and almost no one knows about it, which is also not accurate. The Social Security Administration notes that the additional earnings are credited to the earnings that are averaged over a person's working lifetime, not directly to their monthly benefit amount. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is based on a real policy, but the details are incorrect."

The evidence provided suggests that the charges brought against those involved in the riot are related to specific actions they took on that day, and there is no indication that the government is targeting a large group of people based on their political beliefs or affiliation with a particular political party. However, the claim does have some basis in the fact that some individuals have been charged with crimes and may face legal consequences, which could potentially impact their constitutional rights.

While Uttar Pradesh did report a significant decline in cases, it is unclear whether ivermectin was the sole reason for this decline. The state's low case count may be attributed to a combination of factors, including widespread vaccination, mask-wearing, and social distancing measures. Additionally, experts have questioned the credibility of the claim, citing the lack of peer-reviewed randomized control studies and the potential for underreporting of cases. Therefore, while ivermectin may have played a role in the decline of cases, it is not the sole cause, and the claim is therefore HALF-TRUE."

He was indicted on federal charges because investigators found he brought a gun with him onto Capitol grounds and then made false statements to federal agents in a recorded interview.

Instead, the department sent a letter to pass along information about court rulings, and it does encourage mask wearing in accordance with CDC and ADHS guidelines. The department has no authority to give a green light to policies, and it does not support Critical (Race) Theory.

The video shows that the voter was having trouble casting a vote for the Republican candidate, but it also appears to work when the voter touches the name of the Democratic candidate. Additionally, the county's superintendent of elections stated that the issue was not widespread and that voters have the ability to double-check their votes before casting their ballots, which is a safeguard to protect the integrity of the vote. While the incident is concerning, it is not evidence of widespread fraud or a deliberate attempt to prevent Republican voters from casting their ballots."

The study's title states that a mortality rate \"close to zero\" could theoretically be achieved at 50 ng/mL, but does not claim that it has been achieved. Additionally, subsequent research has been mixed and has not consistently supported the claim that vitamin D levels of 50 ng/mL are correlated with zero mortality rate from COVID.

For instance, in 1969, Linwood Holton became the first Republican to win Virginia's governorship in 100 years, while Richard Nixon was the president. Similarly, in 2013, Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, won the governorship while Barack Obama was the president.

However, the claim that it impairs DNA repair is not entirely accurate. The study found that the spike protein hinders the recruitment of specific proteins involved in DNA repair, but it does not directly impair DNA repair itself.

The evidence also highlights that the bill excludes non-infrastructure elements, such as research and development, domestic manufacturing, clean energy tax credits, and capital investments in housing, schools, child care centers, veterans hospitals, and other federal buildings. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's categorization of the bill's spending also supports this conclusion, showing that the majority of the bill's spending is dedicated to traditional infrastructure provisions.

However, the claim that new Legislative maps could be drawn to \"represent that 50-50 split\" is not entirely accurate.

The claim is based on an unverified statement by a former Pfizer employee, Dr. Yeadon, who did not provide any evidence to back his claim. Additionally, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is an open system where anyone can submit a report, and the reports are not verified, making it unreliable for determining vaccine safety.

While it is true that vaccinated people can still get COVID-19, the evidence suggests that unvaccinated people are far more likely to catch and spread the virus, and are at a higher risk of being hospitalized or dying. The claim is also supported by the fact that the virus spread widely in the spring and fall of 2020, before vaccines were widely available, and that the delta variant was first detected in an unvaccinated population. However, it is also true that vaccinated people can still get COVID-19, and that some vaccinated people may be at risk of getting severe cases of COVID-19 due to immune system deficiencies.

The New Jersey state Division of Elections notes that provisional ballots are intended for voters \"whose eligibility to vote cannot be confirmed at the polls on Election Day.\" The poll worker in the video says she is unsure of the man's eligibility but will provide a ballot so that his eligibility can be assessed later, as the law allows.

Hinson and Miller-Meeks did not vote against the entire bill, but rather against the additional $550 billion in new spending. They did not explicitly state that they were denying rural Iowans broadband internet. In fact, Miller-Meeks listed broadband as a priority in her press release, and Hinson supported the existing spending on broadband. The claim relies on a misleading tweet by Loebsack, which implies that the representatives' votes were solely about denying rural Iowans broadband, when in reality, their votes were about the overall spending and priorities in the bill.

However, the evidence suggests that the average job gain during the five months prior to Biden's presidency was around 321,000, and the average job gain during his presidency was around 620,000. This means that the claim is partially true, as the job gains did increase under Biden, but the exact numbers are exaggerated. The claim also states that 4,000 people a day were dying from Covid under the previous administration, and that this number is now down 75%. The evidence suggests that the number of daily deaths was not publicly reported, but the claim is likely referring to the peak of around 3,000-4,000 daily deaths in January 2021. The evidence also suggests that the number of daily deaths has decreased significantly under the Biden administration, but the exact percentage decrease is not provided.

While it is true that Rittenhouse's trial was televised, it was because it was held in a state court where cameras are allowed, whereas Maxwell's trial is being held in a federal court where cameras are not typically allowed. The claim's implication that the media is hiding something or presenting the trials differently due to the nature of the crimes or the people involved is not supported by the evidence.

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim is partially true, but it oversimplifies and exaggerates the events that occurred in Seattle's police-free protest zone, known as CHOP. While Raz Simone did give out a gun to a fellow protester, there is no evidence linking that gun to fatal shootings that occurred in and near CHOP. Additionally, there is no evidence that a paramilitary force carried out the shootings, and Simone did not \"conquer\" the area or rob locals. The claim also implies that Simone was the leader of the area, which is not supported by evidence.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Timothy Simpkins, a Black teen shooter, got 1 day in jail and $75,000 bail, while Kyle Rittenhouse, a white teen, got 2 months in jail and $2 million bail. The evidence shows that Simpkins was released from jail on October 7, 2021, after paying a $75,000 bond, which is consistent with the claim. However, the claim also states that Simpkins got 1 day in jail, which is incorrect. Simpkins was in jail for at least 1 day, as he was arrested on October 6, 2021, and released the next day. Additionally, the claim implies that Rittenhouse got 2 months in jail, which is also incorrect. Rittenhouse was released from jail on November 20, 2020, after posting a $2 million bail, which is more than 10 months after his arrest.

While it is true that the bill provides a form of parole to certain immigrants who are in the country without permission, the claim is misleading because it implies that this parole is equivalent to a pardon or early release from prison, which is not the case. In immigration law, parole refers to a process that gives people temporary permission to stay in the country for humanitarian or other reasons, and it does not necessarily imply that the individual has been convicted of a crime. Additionally, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the parole is available to people who have been convicted of crimes in the U.S., which is not the case. The bill specifically states that people convicted of crimes in the U.S. would not be eligible for immigration parole under this provision.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) cited three main factors for the increase: rising health care costs, a move by Congress last year that held the premium increase to just $3 a month because of the pandemic, and the need to raise money for a possible unprecedented surge in drug costs. Inflation was not on that list. Additionally, Medicare is largely immune from inflation because the program sets prices for hospitals and doctors.

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's 2021 report, 31-40% of renter households in Wisconsin are severely cost-burdened, which means they pay more than 50% of their income for housing.

The warrants for the search indicate that the agency is investigating potential crimes including intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud, conspiracy to cause intentional damage to a protected computer, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. There is no evidence to support the claim that Bishop was targeted because of her protests. The article's claim that the FBI is treating parents like her as domestic terrorists is also debunked.

Additionally, the bill includes funding to strengthen tax enforcement and expand audits, but the goal is to target the rich, not individuals who spend $28 a day. The claim is also misleading as it implies that spending $28 a day would trigger an audit, which is not the case.

While the bill does expand the federal government's role in child care, it does not nationalize the industry or give the federal government direct control over child care facilities. Instead, it provides funding and sets certain standards for states to follow in order to receive the funding. States will have significant autonomy in implementing the program, and parents will still have the ability to choose the child care provider that best fits their needs. The bill also includes provisions that allow for religious institutions to participate in the program, but with certain restrictions.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Expanding Medicaid, which if we had done at the beginning of the Abbott administration, would have brought in $100 billion to this state's economy\" is partially true. The evidence suggests that the original estimate of $100 billion in federal funding for Medicaid expansion in Texas was based on a 2013 report by Billy Hamilton Consulting, which analyzed federal funding under scenarios of minimal, moderate, and high enrollment levels. The report estimated that Texas would receive nearly $100 billion in federal funding over a decade if it expanded Medicaid. However, more recent estimates suggest that the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive if it expanded Medicaid is likely to be significantly lower, ranging from $5 billion to $6 billion annually. Therefore, while the claim is based on a valid estimate, it is not entirely accurate, and the actual amount of federal funding Texas would receive is likely to be lower than the original estimate."

The evidence provided shows that Berenson's conclusion is based on a flawed comparison between people in a 50-year age range, without taking into account the age distribution in the population and the fact that the vaccinated population skews older. The government's analysis of the same data set, which takes into account age-standardized mortality rates and other variables, shows that the age-adjusted risk of death involving COVID-19 is 32 times greater in unvaccinated people than in fully vaccinated individuals, and that mortality rates are consistently lower for people who have received two vaccinations compared with one or no vaccinations. The footnote on the table provided by Berenson himself explains that the higher mortality rate among vaccinated people in the 10-to-59 age group is due to the fact that the vaccinated population is older on average, which increases mortality rates.

Additionally, even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that's stationary during a traffic jam, which is sufficient to keep the occupants comfortable. Furthermore, a British consumer watchdog group tested an electric vehicle's battery performance during a simulated traffic jam and found that the car's main 77 kWh battery lost only 2% of its power after 75 minutes of using various functions, which is equivalent to 8 miles of driving range.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Even after accounting for rising prices, the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year\" is partially true. According to the evidence, per capita, inflation-adjusted disposable personal income has risen fairly steadily since the first quarter of 2016, and was higher in the third quarter of 2021 than in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, this trend is partly due to government payments and changes in consumer spending habits during the pandemic, rather than solely due to economic growth. The evidence suggests that the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year, but the claim oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to this increase."

The evidence shows that the article in question is misleading and misinterprets the data from the UK Health Security Agency's report. The report warns against using the raw data to estimate vaccine effectiveness due to inherent biases present in the data, such as differences in risk, behavior, and testing between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. The report also notes that the high overall vaccination rate in the UK and differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations may skew the numbers. Additionally, the report highlights that the vaccines are highly effective against the delta COVID variant, with effectiveness rates ranging from 90%-99% for preventing hospitalization and mortality.

According to Reynolds' research, there are 161 examples of the Senate establishing work-arounds to the ordinary 60-vote requirement to push past a filibuster. While some experts note that not all carve-outs are equal and that some may be more significant than others, the evidence suggests that there have been at least 160 carve-outs to the filibuster over time.

According to the evidence, there were 1,021 reports of deaths from Johnson & Johnson, 3,745 from Moderna, and 4,077 from Pfizer BioNTech, which is fewer than half of the claimed numbers.

The evidence provided shows that while there is a risk of myocarditis after vaccination, it is rare and generally mild, and the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Additionally, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infection remain low in teens, and the risk of illness or death due to the virus is greater than the risk from myocarditis. Public health experts and the CDC have consistently stated that the vaccine is safe and effective for teens, and that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine is the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made this claim, but it is based on flawed data and misinterpretation of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data. The VAERS system is an open-access system that allows anyone to report any health effects after a vaccination, including unrelated events, and the reports are not verified before being entered. The system is designed to generate hypotheses, not provide conclusive evidence of vaccine-related adverse effects. The evidence also shows that the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to over 459 million people in the United States, with only 0.0022% of reports of death, and health officials have not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns of deaths following immunization. Additionally, experts have emphasized that reports of adverse events, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a COVID-19 vaccine caused a health problem. Therefore, the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine is the \"deadliest vaccine ever made\" is FALSE."

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's state infectious-disease agency, states that the risk of people becoming PCR-positive despite vaccination and transmitting the virus is significantly reduced. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that vaccines are critical to controlling the pandemic, as they prevent serious illness and death, and that breakthrough infections were always expected. The evidence also shows that the vaccines' waning efficacy over time is addressed by booster shots, which are recommended by the CDC.

The bill also includes $43.8 billion in funding to give private health insurance to people who would have been covered under Medicaid expansion, which would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care.

However, this poll is not representative of the entire state, as it only surveyed 600 likely general election voters and had a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points.

The credit phases out with rising income, and the Congressional Research Service found that the hike delivered by the Build Back Better Act would be gone for a typical married couple by the time they made about $200,000.

The evidence suggests that mask mandates may have a negative impact on children's ability to recognize and express emotions, which is important for learning and development. The article cited in the letter to Dr. Bernadine Futrell notes that covering the lower half of the face reduces the ability to communicate, interpret, and mimic the expressions of those with whom we interact, which can lead to reduced emotional mimicry, contagion, and emotionality. However, the evidence also suggests that the impact of mask mandates on learning loss is not clear-cut and may depend on various factors, such as the age of the child and the effectiveness of targeted interventions. Additionally, the CDC's Science brief notes that there is limited available data on the impact of masking on emotional or language development in children, and that some studies have found that children can recognize familiar words and wear masks effectively with targeted interventions.

However, the evidence provided shows that the analysis actually found that COVID-19-infected people who had received three doses of a vaccine were 4.5 times MORE LIKELY to have a positive test compatible with omicron compared with an unvaccinated person who tested positive for COVID-19.

The World Health Organization has also issued a statement confirming this, stating that any other interpretation of the statement is 100% incorrect. Additionally, the WHO has consistently promoted the use of vaccines to protect people from COVID-19 and has advised that people more at risk from COVID-19 should receive the vaccine before children, who tend to have milder disease.

However, the claim that corporations are \"overcharging us for gas, medicine, and groceries, and pocketing the difference\" is partially misleading. While it is true that companies have been able to keep profit margins high by cutting costs and passing higher costs along to consumers, the prices of gas, groceries, and medicine have also increased due to factors such as demand and supply chain disruptions. Additionally, some economists argue that the high profit margins are not necessarily a result of companies overcharging consumers, but rather a response to the pandemic and government policies.

The evidence suggests that electric vehicles would not have been more prone to failure in general, but rather would have required more careful planning and management to ensure they had sufficient range to complete their journey. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that electric vehicles would not have been idling, as they would have been stationary, and would not have been using as much power as gas-powered vehicles.

While omicron is indeed the fastest-spreading variant of COVID-19, it is not the fastest-spreading virus known to humankind. According to the evidence, measles is the fastest-spreading virus in terms of transmission from person to person, with a basic reproduction number of 12-18. Omicron, on the other hand, has a basic reproduction number of 1.5-2 times that of the delta variant, which is around 5-7.

Instead, it sets a new standard for what constitutes an acceptable ID and provides workarounds for voters who lack IDs. Additionally, the bill prohibits states from requiring voters to submit IDs to obtain or cast absentee ballots, but does not eliminate the requirement for in-person voting. The claim is also based on a misinterpretation of the HEROES Act, which did propose a provision that allowed voters to meet a state's voter ID requirement by signing a sworn written statement attesting to their identity, but this was not a blanket ban on voter ID requirements.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"half of the bills that were successfully filibustered in the Senate were civil rights legislation\" from 1917 to 1994. While the evidence suggests that a significant number of civil rights bills were indeed filibustered during this period, the exact proportion is disputed among scholars. Sarah Binder's analysis, which is cited by the congresswoman, found that exactly half of the 30 measures identified between 1917 and 1994 addressed civil rights, but other scholars have reached different conclusions. Additionally, the definition of a filibuster and its success are matters of interpretation, which can affect the accuracy of the count. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate due to the uncertainty and disagreement among scholars."

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, did say that over 75% of deaths among vaccinated individuals involved people with at least four comorbidities. However, the claim implies that this is true for all COVID-19 deaths, which is not the case. The study mentioned in the evidence only looked at vaccinated individuals, and the statistic does not apply to the overall population of people who have died from COVID-19.

In reality, Indian citizens must enroll as new voters and their names must appear on electoral lists, and there are reports of citizens, mostly minorities and women, not being able to get their names added to electoral lists or being removed from the lists, which means they cannot vote.

However, it also shows that rising wages erased a significant portion of the inflation bump, with average hourly earnings for private employees rising by 4.7% between December 2020 and December 2021.

However, it's important to note that the study's equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning, and experts stress that what Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level as other states. Additionally, Virginia's eighth-grade math standards were not measured, and the state's students perform well on national exams in both math and reading.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true, but it is also misleading. The CDC study found that people with natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the delta variant than vaccinated people who had never been infected. However, the study had several limitations, including a limited sample size, and did not account for the severity of previous infections or deaths from the virus. Additionally, the study was conducted before the spread of the omicron variant, and the CDC has emphasized that vaccination is the safest form of protection against COVID-19, providing additional protection for people who have already been infected. The claim also ignores the fact that a previous COVID-19 infection does not guarantee that a person will not need medical care if they get the virus again.

While the bill does include significant expansions of social safety-net programs, including affordable health care, housing, and home health care, it is difficult to determine whether it is the largest expansion in 60 years due to the lack of a clear definition of \"welfare programs.\" Some experts argue that the bill is among the most significant expansions of social welfare since the Great Society/War on Poverty programs in the 1960s, but others note that the definition of \"welfare programs\" is subjective and may include or exclude certain provisions. Additionally, the bill's total cost is estimated to be $1.75 trillion over 10 years, not $4 trillion, which further complicates the comparison to previous legislation.

State and local officials would still have significant discretion in many aspects of election administration, such as processing mail ballot requests, operating polling places, and setting up and testing equipment.

Firstly, the claim that the overall COVID-19 death count is inflated by people who died \"with\" rather than \"from\" the virus has been debunked. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the underlying cause of death as \"the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person's death,\" and in 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Secondly, the claim that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in people with four or more comorbidities is also false. This statistic was taken out of context from a statement by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who was referring to a study of COVID-19 deaths in vaccinated people, not all COVID-19 deaths. Finally, the claim that nursing home residents are an already-vulnerable population that should be excluded from the overall count is not supported by scientific evidence, as studies have shown that their risk of dying increased during the pandemic.

However, not all armed robberies would be downgraded to misdemeanors, only those that meet this specific criteria. Additionally, the claim that the DA is stopping prosecuting resisting arrest is also partially true, as Bragg's memo states that resisting arrest would not be prosecuted unless accompanied by another charge not included on the list of offenses the office was generally declining to prosecute.

A closer examination of the evidence shows that Fauci's guidance was nuanced and context-dependent, and that he was responding to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic.

According to the evidence, members of Congress are not exempt from the vaccine mandate because they work directly for the people, not for President Biden, and he therefore has no power to give them orders. However, the evidence also suggests that the vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors is currently blocked by court orders, which means that the claim is not entirely false. Therefore, the verdict is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"With the ongoing pandemic, our State Park attendance is at the highest it\u2019s ever been\" is partially true. According to the evidence, New York state parks had a record-high attendance in 2021, breaking the record set in 2020. However, the increase in attendance during the pandemic was smaller compared to the increases prior to the pandemic. The attendance figures show that the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than the increases prior to the pandemic, with a growth of around 427,000 visitors in 2021 compared to 2020, whereas the growth was over 2.9 million visitors between 2018 and 2019, and over 2.6 million visitors between 2017 and 2018. Therefore, while the claim is true that attendance was at a record high, it is not entirely accurate to say that it is the highest it has ever been, as the growth rate during the pandemic was smaller compared to previous years."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Total deaths from COVID MUCH LOWER than reported\" is partially true. The evidence suggests that the number of deaths attributed solely to COVID-19 might be lower than the overall number of deaths involving COVID-19. According to the Office for National Statistics, in England and Wales, there were 17,371 deaths where COVID-19 was the sole cause of death, while there were 131,641 deaths overall where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that the reported death toll is inflated, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the reported death toll is accurate, and the difference between the two numbers is due to the fact that COVID-19 is often mentioned as a contributing factor to death, even if it was not the sole cause. Additionally, the claim is made by a single individual, John Campbell, who is not a credible source, and the claim is not supported by any credible scientific evidence.

However, the claim exaggerates the situation by stating that 50,000-100,000 Americans are infected by Delta every day, which is not supported by the evidence. Additionally, the claim implies that Biden is directly responsible for the removal of the treatments, which is not accurate. The FDA made the decision based on the effectiveness of the treatments against the omicron variant.

The academic paper analyzed by Bowman's office found that the number of Black and Latino students admitted through affirmative action was higher than the number of white legacy students admitted, but only when considering the numbers individually. The claim also does not account for the fact that legacy admissions are not exclusive to white students, and that Black and Latinx students can also benefit from legacy admissions.

For example, President Reagan's nomination of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was motivated in part by his desire to appoint the first woman to the Court, and President Trump's nomination of Justice Amy Coney Barrett was motivated in part by his desire to appoint a woman to the Court. Additionally, the evidence shows that race and gender have played a role in other Supreme Court nominations throughout history.

In reality, ballot harvesting is a legal practice in many states, including Wisconsin, where voters can designate someone to return their absentee ballot for them. The claim also fails to acknowledge that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has provided guidance to clerks stating that both drop boxes and delivery of ballots by other individuals are permitted.

The evidence suggests that Pfizer's effort is based on scientific data and rigorous testing, and the company is not using the government or fear to push the vaccine. Additionally, the claim implies that Pfizer is motivated by profit, which is not supported by the evidence. While Pfizer does stand to make money from the vaccine, the company's primary goal is to provide a safe and effective vaccine to protect public health. The claim is also misleading in its characterization of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as the evidence suggests that the vaccine has been thoroughly tested and has a good safety profile. Overall, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is based on some factual information, but it is exaggerated and misleading in its characterization of Pfizer's motivations and the vaccine's safety and effectiveness."

The evidence suggests that the books mentioned in the claim have not been removed from libraries statewide, and that the removal of books is typically done on a case-by-case basis through a transparent process. Additionally, Mein Kampf is not mentioned in the evidence as being banned or challenged in Texas. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also contains an error."

Additionally, the bill's purpose is to allow parents to watch a livestream of their child's class, not to spy on teachers and children.

Additionally, research from behavioral economics and psychology has found that intense emotions like anger and sadness can cause people to take actions they later regret, and inserting a short delay in the gun-buying process can reduce gun violence (Behavioral Scientist article, 2018). However, the evidence also suggests that waiting periods may not be effective in all situations, such as when guns are bought \"off the black market\" or when a gun is needed for self-defense.

However, the actual available generation capacity is lower due to the limitations of wind and solar power, which do not operate at 100% capacity all the time. The evidence suggests that the grid's actual available capacity is around 86,000 megawatts, which is lower than the total installed capacity.

This form is issued for civil violations, such as entering the country without proper documentation or overstaying a visa, and is often the only form of identification available to individuals released by ICE.

The evidence provided confirms this claim, citing a press call with Senator Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who stated that the number of encounters was 518,000, which is a 137% increase from the same period in FY2021. Additionally, the evidence provides further details on the increase in encounters, including the fact that the number of encounters has continued to grow since Grassley made the statement, and that the increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the requirement for non-U.S. citizens to show proof of vaccination to enter the country.

The tweet was not specifically targeting the Super Bowl or COVID-19 vaccination, but rather was part of the CDC's ongoing efforts to educate the public about the risks of blood clots. The claim that the CDC was \"normalizing blood clots\" is an exaggeration and is likely intended to create a false narrative about the CDC's intentions."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim is partially true because Texas' public pension systems do invest in Chinese companies, which are funded in part with tax dollars. However, the claim is also partially false because the governor, Greg Abbott, does not directly invest tax money in Chinese companies. The investment decisions are made by the pension systems' boards and managers, and the governor's role is limited to oversight and appointing board members. The claim is an exaggeration and misleads the public by implying that the governor is directly responsible for the investments."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"the global economies shutting down all at once, reopening all at once\" caused inflation, which is partially supported by the evidence. Patrick Gaspard, a panelist, made this claim, and the evidence shows that the global economies did shut down and reopen rapidly, which contributed to the current high inflation rate. However, the claim also states that the U.S. economy is recovering at a far faster pace than any other country in the OECD, which is partially supported by the evidence. The OECD report and other calculations show that the U.S. economy has indeed grown rapidly, but not all experts agree that this is the sole cause of inflation. The evidence suggests that there are other factors at play, such as the pandemic, and that the relationship between rapid growth and high inflation is not perfect. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The Emergencies Act does give the federal government, police, and banks specific powers, including the ability to freeze personal and corporate accounts without a court order. However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that the Act is tantamount to martial law, which typically involves the suspension of civil rights and the rule by military authorities. Trudeau explicitly stated that he will not call in the military and that the Act does not suspend fundamental rights or override the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Act is being used to address a public order emergency caused by blockades and occupations, not to impose martial law.

Additionally, the evidence highlights specific examples of schools in Texas and North Carolina that still require masks, despite their states not having statewide mandates.

The data was collected in 2016 and early 2017, before Trump took office. However, the claim that the Clinton campaign spied on the president is an exaggeration, as the data was not collected after Trump took office, and the purpose of the data collection was to gather information about potential links between the Trump Organization and Russia, not to spy on Trump himself.

Additionally, the claim exaggerates the amount of stock sold, as Bancel sold $6.1 million worth of stock in February, not $400 million.

The investigation was part of the Clinton campaign's efforts to understand the Russian interference in the 2016 election. Additionally, the court filing by Durham does not support the claim of spying, but rather alleges that Sussmann made a false statement to the FBI about the nature of his meeting with the FBI.

Additionally, the report notes that the vetting process was done with the information available at the time, and the administration did not have access to biometric and biographical data from foreign allies until late 2021.

The evidence suggests that drug seizures have been increasing since at least 2016, and the trend predates Biden's presidency. Additionally, experts argue that seizures are a problematic way to measure the effectiveness of border protection, as traffickers constantly adapt their tactics to evade detection.

However, the claim is also misleading because it only focuses on the first year in office, which is cherry-picked to show a positive trend. The evidence also shows that homicides fluctuated under Irvin's tenure, and the claim ignores the increase in homicides in his second year in office.

The Associated Press investigation found fewer than 475 voter fraud cases in six battleground states, which represents 0.15% of Biden's victory margin. Most of the cases involved lone actors or administrative errors, and there is no evidence of \"rigging\" or collusion.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the Keystone XL pipeline would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, more than enough to offset what the US imports from Russia. While it is true that the pipeline would have had the capacity to carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day, the evidence suggests that the US was already importing over 800,000 barrels per day from Russia in May 2021, and this figure had decreased to 595,000 by October 2021. Therefore, the claim is only half-true because it is based on a static figure of 830,000 barrels per day, without considering the actual import figures from Russia, which were already above that amount. Additionally, the claim implies that the pipeline would have solved the US's demand needs, which is not supported by the evidence, as the pipeline would have required years of construction and faced legal challenges, and even then, there would be no certainty that it would produce a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day."

The evidence suggests that when considering the annual percentage increase, 2021's 4.4% increase was not the highest in history, and the economy is still below its pre-pandemic peak.

The sanctions did have carve-outs for certain financial transactions, including some related to the energy industry. However, the claim is also exaggerated, as some sanctions did take effect quickly, and the sanctions were not entirely ineffective.

The claim that masks are a symbol of paranoia is also partially true, as some people may view mask-wearing as an overreaction to the pandemic.

Additionally, the Republican Party's platform on arming Ukraine has been inconsistent, with the 2016 platform supporting providing Ukraine with weapons and the 2020 platform not adopting a new platform, but rather reiterating support for Trump and his administration.

Additionally, the Kremlin's transcripts of Putin's conversations reveal no mention of child trafficking, and the Real Raw News article that made the claim is known for fabricating sources, stories, headlines, and bylines.

The correct figure is 60%, which is based on a 1991 report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, this figure is over 30 years old, and more recent data is limited. A 2000 study found a net gain of 17,619 acres of wetlands in five geographic zones in New York state from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but this increase accounted for less than 1% of the state's existing wetlands acreage.

However, this was not a direct report from CNN, but rather a report from the companies themselves, which was broadcasted by CNN and other news outlets. Additionally, Walensky was not working for the CDC at the time, so she would have received this information through the same channels as the general public.

The current high price of oil is due to a combination of factors, including the global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the global market's response to these events. The claim also implies that the Biden administration is solely responsible for the high oil prices, which is not supported by the evidence. Energy experts state that the oil industry is making a profit and choosing not to invest in new production, and that the Biden administration does not have the legal tools to force companies to produce more oil.

The claim is also correct that Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell profits are at their highest level in over 7 years. However, the claim's focus on the 1% figure and the timing of the high profits is misleading, as the high profits were not solely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The pipeline would not have been able to solve the demand needs of the US and would have required years of construction and likely faced legal challenges. Additionally, the ad's claim that the cancellation increased dependence on Russian oil is not supported by the S&P Global Report, which actually states that Russia filled the gap left by US oil sanctions on Venezuela.

Additionally, the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline and the pause on new oil and gas lease sales on government land did not impact production levels.

However, the evidence also suggests that the industry has not been using these permits, and there are various reasons for this, including the need to assess the durability of the global rebound, the cost of drilling, and the pressure from the financial community to pay dividends and do share buybacks.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the entire 33.35 cents goes to the state, whereas some of it goes to local governments and the federal government.

The evidence shows that O'Rourke was actually referring to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's order to investigate parents for child abuse for providing gender-affirming care for transgender children, not his own plan.

However, the evidence shows that Harris was actually asked about gasoline prices and inflation in a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, not Polish President Andrzej Duda. Harris did pause before responding, but it was not because she was trying to defer to President Duda, but rather because she was taken aback by the question. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in stating that Harris was asked about gasoline prices, but it is inaccurate in stating that she was asked by President Duda and that she tried to defer to him."

The presence of apes does raise questions about the concept of evolution, as it can be confusing to understand how humans and apes evolved from a common ancestor. However, the evidence provided suggests that humans and apes did evolve from ancient apes, and that the apes alive today are not the same kinds of apes that were alive millions of years ago. The concept of evolution is not called into question by the presence of apes, but rather, it is a natural part of the evolutionary process."

The evidence suggests that the rise in gas prices was a complex phenomenon driven by multiple factors, including the economic recovery from the pandemic, low investment in production during the pandemic, and the refusal of OPEC and its allies to increase production. While Putin's actions did contribute to the price increase, they were not the sole cause. The claim also ignores the fact that the majority of the rise in gas prices occurred before the troop buildup became a major story in November 2021. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence shows that the price of oil and gas has increased, and some experts argue that it takes time for gas prices to respond to changes in crude oil costs. However, the claim is also misleading because it cherry-picks data and ignores other factors that affect gas prices, such as inflation, labor costs, and local market conditions. Additionally, the comparison between 2008 and 2022 is not entirely accurate, as there are unique circumstances in each year that affect the price of oil and gas.

This matches the claim's figure of 80 cents for every dollar. However, the evidence also notes that this figure is not an apples-to-apples comparison of men and women performing the same work, and that the pay gap is influenced by various factors such as women's greater responsibility for child-rearing, their choice of occupations, and their work history.

In contrast, the US has a more robust system of free speech, with independent news organizations, a diverse range of information, and no government coercion to control the media. While there may be some similarities between the two countries, such as the existence of state-owned media outlets in the US, the overall environment for free speech in the US is much more permissive and less restrictive than in Russia.

The bulk of such subsidies can only be overturned by congressional action, not unilaterally by Biden. Additionally, Biden's executive order did not eliminate all subsidies, and he has proposed ending certain subsidies in his budget, but these would require congressional approval.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations\" is partially true. While it is true that the price of insulin has increased significantly over the years, the evidence suggests that the situation is more complex and multifaceted. The American Action Forum report shows that the average list price of insulin increased 11% annually from 2001 to 2018, but the Health Care Cost Institute report reveals that the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82, with the highest spending category having a median monthly out-of-pocket spending of $315. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also notes that Americans pay 10 times what people in other developed countries pay. However, the evidence also suggests that there are other factors involved in pricing and that the savings from rebates are not always passed through to patients. The Senate Finance Committee report notes that pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s, but it does not solely blame the drug companies for the high prices. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it oversimplifies the complex issue of insulin pricing and does not provide a complete understanding of the factors involved."

Additionally, the article in question was about McCormick's appointment to a Commerce Department post, not about the layoffs or offshoring.

While the Biden administration has implemented policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel production and use, such as suspending drilling and mining on Bureau of Land Management property and canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, these policies are not the sole cause of high gas prices. The evidence suggests that the main factors contributing to high gas prices are the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and disruptions to global supply and demand. The article cites a report from the New York Times stating that gas prices have risen largely in response to the pandemic and the decrease in supply and increase in demand. Additionally, the article notes that gas prices were already rising before the Biden administration took office, and that the Keystone XL pipeline's cancellation would have had a minimal impact on global oil production. Therefore, while the Biden administration's policies may have contributed to some extent, they are not the primary cause of high gas prices."

The data from the Energy Information Administration shows an increasing trend in gas prices since April 2020, nine months before Biden took office. Additionally, the sharpest increases at the pump have come since the start of the war in Ukraine, which is not directly related to the Keystone XL pipeline.

While it is true that Judge Jackson handed down sentences below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were requesting in some cases, it is also important to note that this is not a consistent pattern and that judges and prosecutors often give lesser sentences than what the government wants. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the distinction between production and possession of child pornography, which is an important factor in determining sentence length. Furthermore, the claim does not provide context about the severity of the crimes and the circumstances of the cases, which can also impact sentence length.

Corrections custody should be released due to the pandemic, the context of the statement is crucial. Jackson's statement was part of a ruling in a specific case, where she was considering the release of a defendant who was seeking to be released from the D.C. jail to home confinement due to the pandemic. She did not advocate for releasing all defendants without considering individual circumstances. Additionally, Blackburn's statement cherry-picks part of Jackson's ruling, omitting the fact that Jackson also wrote about the constraints on judicial authority and the need to assess an inmate's flight risk and dangerousness before releasing them.

The evidence suggests that the energy payback time for wind turbines is relatively short, ranging from less than one year to six years, depending on the study. This means that the initial greenhouse gas emissions from building and decommissioning wind turbines are spread out over the turbine's lifespan, resulting in a lower carbon footprint per kilowatt hour. However, the claim implies that the overall return is negative, which is not supported by the evidence.

However, when considering the absolute numbers, the United States is indeed the leader in terms of the total metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions reduced. However, when looking at the relative change in emissions, many economic peers, such as the UK, Italy, France, and Germany, have achieved steeper declines. Additionally, the claim does not account for emissions per capita, which would show that the United States still has higher emissions per capita compared to countries like China and India.

While it is true that some stores may not have certain types of bread or may experience temporary shortages due to labor shortages or other factors, it is not accurate to say that all stores do not have bread. The evidence suggests that most stores are stocked with bread, and any outages are typically driven by labor shortages rather than a complete lack of bread. Additionally, the evidence notes that even during times of shortages, stores may still have other varieties of bread available.

While it is true that some cities in Texas and Florida saw a higher increase in murders, the overall increase in violent crime in these states was not significantly higher than in NYS. According to the evidence, the increase in murders in NYS was higher than in Texas and Florida when looking at the statewide data, and the increase in aggravated assaults was lower in NYS compared to the other two states.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Senate Republicans' plan\" would \"end Social Security\" and \"end Medicare\" is partially true, but also partially misleading. The plan proposed by Sen. Rick Scott does not directly call for ending these programs, but rather suggests that all federal legislation, including those creating Social Security and Medicare, would sunset within five years unless explicitly renewed by Congress. This means that the fate of these programs would be left to the whims of Congress, which could potentially lead to their termination. However, it is important to note that the plan is not a unified proposal from all Senate Republicans, and some leading Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have rejected parts of it. Additionally, the plan's language is open to interpretation, and it is unclear whether Congress would actually allow these programs to expire. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also partially misleading and oversimplifies the complexity of the issue."

While there is a possibility that a child could get sick from a visit to the doctor, experts in the field of pediatrics and medicine widely tout well-child visits as key for child health and parent information. The evidence also highlights the importance of infection control precautions in healthcare settings, which minimize the risk of transmission of illnesses. The claim is also contradicted by multiple studies, including the University of Iowa study mentioned in the article, which found no increased risk of infection from well-child visits.

Additionally, the claim is comparing apples to apples, as the health systems for veterans and migrants in ICE detention centers are different. Furthermore, the claim does not account for the fact that veterans are seen by a medical professional in approximately 40 days on average in 2021, and wait times vary depending on the service and location.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the Democrat's plan would tax billionaires to lower the deficit by $1 trillion and fund clean energy independence, which is partially true.

This tax would generate $360 billion in revenue over the next decade, not $1 trillion. Additionally, the claim mentions funding clean energy initiatives, which is also true, as the budget sets aside $45 billion for climate change efforts. However, the claim is exaggerated and lacks important context about both policies, as the evidence suggests. The Republican plan, on the other hand, is not accurately described in the claim, as it appears to be a reference to an 11-point proposal by Sen.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"The price of insulin increases as waistlines increase\" is partially true. While it is true that the number of diabetes cases has increased over the years, and obesity is a risk factor for developing Type 2 diabetes, the evidence suggests that the increase in insulin prices is not directly related to the increase in waistlines. The experts consulted in the article agree that the list price of insulin has increased over the past decade, but this is due to various factors such as the pharmaceutical industry's pricing strategy, the role of pharmacy benefit managers, and the lack of competition in the market. The article also highlights that production costs are unlikely to change significantly with increased demand, and that the manufacturers and other stakeholders benefit from higher list prices, except for the consumers who have to purchase it to survive. Therefore, while there is a correlation between the increase in diabetes cases and the increase in insulin prices, the claim that the price of insulin increases as waistlines increase is only partially true."

Additionally, the amendment would have required insurance companies to offer at least one comprehensive plan that followed the Affordable Care Act's rules, which would have still provided coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

In fact, he has expressed uncertainty about how long the protection lasts and has spoken encouragingly about it on several occasions. However, the claim is also partially true because Fauci's 2004 statement, taken out of context, may be misinterpreted as downplaying the importance of natural immunity. The evidence suggests that Fauci's statement was made in the context of influenza, not COVID-19, and was influenced by the limited understanding of immunity against respiratory viruses at the time. Additionally, Fauci's current stance on natural immunity is more nuanced, acknowledging its protective benefits while also emphasizing the importance of vaccination.

The Democratic Party's claim is misleading because it compares the House budget to the proposed budget by former Governor Northam, which included a $2.4 billion increase in education spending, rather than comparing it to the current budget.

While Oz did write that \"let's add in more access to health care; less access to guns that aren't designed for hunting\" in a 2013 column, he did not specify how to achieve \"less access\" to guns.

The claim states that if you earn $100 and pay $33 income tax, you're left with $67, and then you buy $67 worth of fuel and pay a 48% fuel tax. However, the evidence shows that the fuel tax in Australia is not 48%, but rather 22.1 cents per liter, which is a much lower rate. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the GST, which is a 10% tax on gas purchases. The total taxes paid on a $67 gas purchase would be around 19%, not 48%. The claim also lacks context about income tax rates, which vary depending on the country and individual circumstances. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and exaggerated."

The $33 million figure is also not a direct injection of funds, but rather a total of grants made over a period of time. Additionally, the grants were not exclusively for the Black Lives Matter movement, but rather for a broader range of social justice initiatives.

While it is true that consuming large amounts of sugar can increase the risk of certain cancers, the evidence does not support the claim that sugar is a direct cause of cancer. The evidence suggests that the relationship between sugar and cancer is more complex, and that other factors, such as weight gain and excess body fat, may play a larger role in the development of certain cancers. Additionally, the claim that avoiding sugar is the best way to prevent cancer is also an oversimplification, as a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods and nutrients is likely to be more effective in reducing the risk of cancer."

While it is true that the US government is distributing smartphones to some immigrants who have been detained after entering the country illegally, the claim is misleading because it implies that the phones are being given away as a gift or for personal use. In reality, the phones are being issued as part of ICE's Alternative to Detention program to track immigrants who have been released from detention and are awaiting a deportation hearing. The phones are pre-loaded with an app called SmartLINK that requires users to check in with immigration officials and do not have the capability to make personal phone calls, check social media, or browse the internet.

This aligns with his earlier statements in the 1990s, where he supported a woman's right to choose and voted against measures that would have restricted access to abortion. While he has also described himself as \"pro-life\" at times, this is a nuanced position that does not necessarily contradict his support for a woman's right to choose.

The document was later released, and the numbers were made public. While Pfizer did hire more employees to process adverse event reports, this was to meet the demands of processing an influx of unvetted reports, not to hide the information.

The CPI increased in February 2021, March 2021, April 2021, May 2021, June 2021, July 2021, August 2021, and September 2021, but not in January 2021. Additionally, the claim that \"just hit another 40-year high\" is also partially true, as the inflation rate did reach its highest point in 40 years in March 2022, sitting at about 8.5%.

Additionally, his campaign rhetoric and policy positions are not friendly to China, and he has criticized the Biden administration on issues such as inflation, border policy, and foreign policy.

In fact, the EPA and many car manufacturers have approved the use of E15 fuel in their vehicles, and studies have shown no evidence of engine durability or maintenance issues. However, it is also true that E15 fuel may not be suitable for all vehicles, such as those with heavy-duty engines or certain non-road vehicles.

The claim implies that the current justice reform policies are responsible for James being able to commit the attack, which is not supported by the evidence.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Canada's new law allows the government to take children away if parents don't accept their \"gender identity.\" However, the evidence provided shows that the 2017 Child, Youth and Family Services Act aimed to strengthen and modernize child welfare services, including making them more inclusive and culturally relevant. The law added \"gender identity\" and \"gender expression\" to the list of factors considered by child protection workers, but this does not mean that children can be taken away solely because of a parent's refusal to accept their gender identity. In fact, the Ontario Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services explicitly stated that child protection workers cannot remove children from their families solely on this basis. The claim is an exaggeration and misrepresentation of the actual changes made to the law."

However, the evidence retrieved shows that the settlement agreement was not a consent decree, but rather a compromise settlement agreement and release. The agreement did not mention voter ID law, and Georgia law still requires photo identification when voting in person or absentee. Additionally, the agreement did not open up the door to fraudulent ballots, and the presidential election results in Georgia were counted three times, with each showing Biden won.

The evidence from the Voice of America article and the testimony of Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Council, supports this claim. According to Reichlin-Melnick, the lack of collateral consequences for individuals expelled under Title 42, such as no opportunity to appeal immigration decisions or challenge a decision to expel someone from the U.S., has incentivized many migrants to try again, leading to an increase in repeated border crossings. This evidence suggests that Title 42 has indeed contributed to the border crisis."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"mRNA Vaccines Show No Mortality Benefit - Danish Study\" is partially true. The study found that the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna did not show a significant reduction in overall mortality, as 61 out of 74,193 participants died, with 31 receiving the vaccine and 30 receiving a placebo. However, the study also found that the adenovirus-vector vaccines showed a significant reduction in overall mortality, with 46 deaths out of 122,164 participants. Additionally, the study found that the mRNA vaccines did not show a significant reduction in COVID-19 mortality, with only two out of 31 deaths in the mRNA-vaccinated group being due to COVID-19. Therefore, while the claim is partially true in the sense that the mRNA vaccines did not show a significant reduction in overall mortality, it is also misleading because it does not provide the full context of the study's findings and does not specify that the results are about non-COVID-19 related deaths."

The data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, also contradicts Prager's claim. Additionally, the experts cited in the evidence do not provide any evidence to support the claim that Black students are \"overwhelmingly\" responsible for hate crimes on college campuses.

The claim also states that Katie Hobbs has been found guilty of racial discrimination, which is partially true.

The claim also relies on outdated and potentially misleading data, and the concept of \"living paycheck to paycheck\" is not well-defined. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that many Americans making high salaries may also be living paycheck to paycheck due to irresponsible financial management or high expenses. The evidence suggests that the actual percentage of Americans living paycheck to paycheck is likely lower than 76%, and the claim is an exaggeration."

However, it does not explicitly state that small businesses did not benefit at all. In fact, the evidence mentions that some small businesses may have benefited from the tax break, but the majority of the benefits went to the wealthy owners of large companies. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that the tax break benefited the wealthiest individuals, but it is not entirely accurate that it did not benefit small businesses at all."

According to the evidence, the Brookings Institution states that 56% of the outstanding student debt is owed by households that hold graduate degrees. However, this does not necessarily mean that 60% of the debt was spent on graduate school. As Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert, points out, many households have undergraduate debt even though someone in the household also has a graduate degree, and assuming that all student loans in a household are graduate school debt significantly overstates the amount of graduate school debt. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office found that in 2017, about 60% of outstanding student loan debt was spent during undergraduate school, while the remaining 40% was spent during graduate school. Therefore, while the claim is partially accurate, it is an oversimplification and should be considered HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Republican politicians are pushing a plan that could raise taxes on almost one in three Wisconsinites and sunset Social Security and Medicare in five years.

Rick Scott, R-Florida, does contain provisions that could raise taxes on a significant number of people, including 32% of Wisconsinites, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Additionally, the plan does propose sunsetting all federal legislation in five years, which could potentially affect Social Security and Medicare. However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that Republicans are uniformly supporting this plan, which is not the case. Sen. Scott himself has stated that it is not the Republican plan and that he is presenting his own approach.

The evidence shows that multiple Republican-controlled states have passed laws that impose prison sentences on doctors who perform or attempt to perform abortions, which contradicts the claim.

This methodology is disputed by experts, and other organizations have produced different results using different criteria.

However, the claim that \"the vast majority\" do not show up is an exaggeration, as the data shows that a majority of immigrants do show up for their hearings.

State Senator Kelda Roys explains that the U.S. Senate is a minority institution, requiring more than a majority of Democrats to control the chamber, and that the 60-vote requirement for cloture is necessary to end debate and move forward with a bill. The evidence also shows that Senate Democrats failed to advance legislation to protect abortion access nationwide, falling short of the 60 votes needed. This supports the claim that Democrats need more than a majority to codify Roe v. Wade."

However, the evidence provided shows that Tennessee did not ban Plan B, and the legislation passed by the state only restricts access to abortion pills, not emergency contraceptives like Plan B. The law imposes a $50,000 penalty for doctors or anyone who dispenses abortion pills by mail, but there is no criminal penalty for patients.

However, the evidence also shows that since then, laws have changed, and more countries have been added to the list.

The US proposal focuses on sharing information and offering resources to affected countries, but does not include any language that would override national decisions. The WHO would not have the power to \"run roughshod over national sovereignty\" as claimed by Bachmann. The evidence provided contradicts the claim, making it FALSE."

While Zack Nunn was involved in private rescue missions and his organization, Task Force Argo, helped evacuate Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan, the exact number of Americans he personally led out of the country is disputed. The evidence suggests that Task Force Argo has evacuated around 61 Americans as of October 2021, and around 561 Americans in total, including those evacuated since then. However, Nunn's claim of saving over 2,000 Americans is likely an exaggeration.

According to the evidence, Perdue did vote for large debt-raising measures, including the 2017 tax cut and the two COVID-19 relief bills. However, the claim that this debt was solely the result of Perdue's actions is false. The evidence shows that the debt increase was a bipartisan effort, and that much of the debt was accumulated through automatic spending on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, the claim that Perdue's spending is driving inflation \"through the roof\" is also false. The evidence suggests that inflation has multiple causes, including global supply chain problems and changes in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that Perdue's spending is only one factor among many.

The investment was made in a company called BIOMILQ, which is still in the development stage and has no connection to the current infant formula shortage.

However, the claim is also partially false in that it implies that the government actively sought to create food shortages to make Native Americans dependent on the government, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the government's inaction was due to a lack of regulation and oversight, rather than a deliberate attempt to create food shortages. Additionally, the claim is anachronistic, as it applies a modern concept of government control to historical events. The government's actions in the 1800s were driven by a desire to expand the country's territory and establish settlements, rather than to create food shortages."

While it is true that the Biden administration is providing baby formula to detained minors at the border, it is not accurate to say that this is a priority over American families. The administration is required by law to provide basic necessities, including food and formula, to detained minors, as outlined in the Flores settlement. The claim also lacks context, as it does not mention the ongoing formula shortage in the US and the fact that some states are struggling more than others. Additionally, the claim is exaggerated, as it implies that the administration is prioritizing formula for immigrants over American families, which is not supported by the evidence.

The American Academy of Pediatrics also strongly advises against homemade formulas, saying they are not safe and do not meet babies' nutritional needs.

Additionally, the evidence shows that prices have risen consistently since then, with a peak of 8.5% in March 2022. While the inflation rate has decreased slightly since then, the claim is still accurate in stating that the inflation rate has increased from 1.7% to over 8%.

The order was intended to provide training and resources to help school board members understand how to report and investigate threats, rather than to suppress parents' right to free speech. Additionally, the claim that Garland \"sicced the police on parents\" implies a level of direct involvement and control over local law enforcement that is not supported by the evidence. While Garland's order may have contributed to an increased police presence at some school board meetings, this was likely a local decision made by individual law enforcement agencies rather than a direct result of Garland's order.

While some studies suggest that plastics can be a more efficient and lightweight material than alternatives, which can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other studies highlight the significant negative impacts of plastic production and disposal on the environment and human health. The American Chemistry Council's report cited in the evidence uses life-cycle studies to show that plastic can perform the functions of paper or glass with less material and weight, leading to less production energy and greenhouse gases. However, other studies, such as the Center for International Environmental Law's report, emphasize the high carbon dioxide emissions associated with plastic manufacturing and disposal.

However, the study's author, Beny Spira, clarified that the correlation does not imply causation, and the study did not conclude that masks caused more deaths. Additionally, an epidemiologist, Emily Smith, pointed out that the correlation could be due to the fact that people are more likely to wear masks when cases are rising, rather than the masks themselves causing the increase in cases.

While it is true that public schools have become more segregated by race and class since the 1960s, the claim is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that segregation in the 1960s was more extreme, with 0.1% of Black students in the South attending majority-white schools in 1960, compared to 14% in 1967. However, the evidence also shows that segregation has increased since the 1980s, with 81% of Black students attending majority-nonwhite schools in 2018. The claim is also nuanced, as modern school segregation is not the same as the government-ordered segregation of the past. The evidence suggests that the decline of court-ordered desegregation and demographic changes, such as declining white birth rates and increasing immigration, have contributed to the resegregation of public schools.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence provided does not support the claim that a January traffic accident involving lab monkeys was responsible for spreading monkeypox to humans. The evidence suggests that the accident occurred on January 21, and the incubation period for monkeypox is typically no longer than 21 days. The current monkeypox outbreak began in mid-May, which is more than 2 months after the accident. Additionally, the woman who was exposed to the monkeys exhibited minor symptoms that did not include a telltale painful skin rash associated with monkeypox. Furthermore, the CDC never reported that the monkeys were infected with monkeypox, and the agency did not provide details about why three of the monkeys were euthanized. The evidence presented is a Facebook meme that stitches together several news events to create an unfounded theory, and it is not supported by credible sources."

The pandemic and its effects on global migration patterns, as well as the dynamics of the pandemic in 2020 and 2022, also played a significant role in the increase. Additionally, the comparison of April 2020 and April 2022 is problematic due to the selective and decontextualized nature of the data presented.

The evidence includes the Uvalde, Texas school shooting where the shooter was able to enter the school unobstructed despite the presence of a school resource officer, and the Santa Fe, Texas school shooting where the shooter was able to storm the campus despite the presence of armed guards. Additionally, research studies have found that school resource officers do not prevent school shootings or gun-related incidents, and that armed guards are not associated with a significant reduction in rates of injuries during school mass shootings.

However, the claim also implies that mass shootings went down when the ban was in place, which is not entirely accurate. While the evidence suggests that mass shooting deaths did decline slightly during the ban, the decline was modest and not statistically significant.

The evidence suggests that 50% of privately purchased firearms were obtained without a background check, but this is based on a national survey and not specific to Texas. Additionally, the survey found that private transfers were a minority of all gun transactions, which means that the majority of gun sales in Texas likely do involve a background check.

The evidence also shows that support for background checks varies across different polls and demographics, and that some respondents may not fully understand the current state of gun laws. Additionally, the claim implies that the 90% support is uniform across all political parties, which is not entirely accurate, as Republicans tend to have lower support for background checks compared to Democrats.

This data supports the claim that more people die from hands, fists, and feet than from rifles. However, it's important to note that the claim is not entirely accurate, as the majority of homicides (77%) were committed with firearms of any kind, and handguns were used in most of those cases.

While it is true that Chicago, LA, and New York have stricter gun laws than Texas, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between gun laws and gun violence. The evidence suggests that while stricter gun laws may have some positive impact, they are not a panacea for gun violence. Additionally, the claim ignores the fact that gun violence is a complex issue influenced by many factors, including socioeconomic conditions, mental health, and cultural factors. Furthermore, the comparison between Chicago and Texas is misleading, as the two cities have different demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and crime rates, which can affect the effectiveness of gun laws. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it presents a simplistic and misleading view of the relationship between gun laws and gun violence."

Additionally, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Rockefeller Institute of Government also found that firearm deaths exceeded traffic deaths among children and teens ages 1-19.

However, the survey did not ask the participants if they actually got an abortion, and the source of the coercion was not specified.

The claim implies that the entire amount was spent on hiring SWAT members, which is not the case. The aid package was designed to sustain Ukraine for months, not to hire SWAT members for every school in the US. Additionally, the claim does not take into account the actual cost of hiring and training SWAT members, as well as the logistics of deploying them to every school. The claim is also misleading in that it implies that hiring SWAT members would be an effective solution to school safety, which is not supported by evidence. While some schools do employ law enforcement or school resource officers, research suggests that this does not prevent mass school shootings.

The evidence provided shows that several candidates, including Trump-endorsed candidates, have won elections with 74% or more of the vote.

The Cleveland State University study found that the total economic impact of the 2016 RNC in Cleveland was $142.2 million, which includes $52.4 million in labor income and $84.8 million in value-added impact. However, the VISIT Milwaukee estimate of $200 million is likely based on a broader definition of economic impact, including indirect benefits such as increased tourism and long-term economic growth.

However, it is important to note that this estimate has not been confirmed independently, and the report does not specify if the costs for clean-up projects are included in the $3 million daily figure. Additionally, the report states that the cost of guarding the materials is only one part of the total cost, as the Defense Department also has to negotiate its withdrawal from seven remaining contracts, which could cost taxpayers at least $798 million and $1.048 billion by the end of 2022.

In fact, the article cites several instances of Republicans committing voter fraud on behalf of deceased voters, which undermines the claim that dead people always vote Democrat.

The US is actually ranked 67th out of 170 countries in terms of gas prices, and the average global price is higher than the US price. Additionally, the claim implies that Biden's administration is solely responsible for the low gas prices, which is not accurate.

Masters was criticizing the government's use of propaganda to win popular support for war, and the quote was used to illustrate the manipulative messaging that he condemned. Additionally, Masters has since clarified that he believes American involvement in World War II was just, and has stepped back from his earlier statement that the US has not been involved in a just war in over 140 years. The claim that Masters called the Unabomber one of his intellectual influencers is also not supported by the evidence provided.

The research cited in the evidence does not provide clear evidence of lives saved, and experts in the field have questioned the accuracy of the estimate.

While President Biden has expressed support for the Green New Deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is no evidence to suggest that his support for the deal has directly caused electricity costs to increase in Texas.

Additionally, there have been several reported threats about possible shootings at Walmart around the country in recent weeks that were false, and at least one that led to an arrest.

The evidence provided shows that waiting periods for gun purchases can actually reduce suicide deaths, and that many suicide deaths are preventable through early intervention and access to help. Additionally, studies have shown that most people who attempt suicide do not go on to die by suicide, and that limiting access to lethal means can prevent suicide deaths.

According to Jennifer Smits, director of communications for the agency's Economic Research Service, the USDA does not publish retail egg prices and does not make predictions about them. The evidence also shows that the USDA publishes forecasts of changes to the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index for foods, but not retail egg prices. Additionally, the evidence provides a specific example of the actual price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in April, which was $2.52, and calculates the expected price increase based on the USDA's forecast, which is significantly lower than the claimed $12 per dozen.

According to the evidence, 35 states have laws that require or request some form of identification to vote, which applied to about 59% of registered voters in the 2020 election. However, the type and strictness of these laws vary across states, with some states allowing provisional ballots or other forms of verification.

Additionally, the military does use miniature drones, but there is no evidence that they have developed a drone that looks and acts like a large fly.

The child died in a fatal amusement park ride accident on July 3, 2021, and the legislation was passed on April 30, 2021, more than 6 months before the accident.

However, the evidence also shows that the case was not about the defendant's actions, but rather about whether the trial court granted him a fair trial. The court's decision was based on the defense's argument that the trial court violated the defendant's rights by preventing the defense from questioning prospective jurors about their possible racial biases.

Marfrig reported a net profit of $820.1 million, which is a 32% increase over 2020. The evidence also shows that meat prices are soaring, with a 12.3% increase over the 12-month period ending May 31, which is higher than the 8.6% inflation rate and 10.1% increase in overall food prices. The evidence does not suggest that the record profits are due to collusion among the companies, but rather unusual economic circumstances brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

However, a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, including all but one member of the G-7 group. The statement is not entirely accurate as it implies that every other major industrial country has a higher inflation rate than the US, which is not the case.

The evidence also provides a breakdown of the numbers, showing that out of every 100,000 Black people living in Virginia, 14.3 were killed in a firearm homicide, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 white Virginians.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"American oil is more affordable\" is partially true, but only in the sense that domestic oil production is not necessarily more expensive than Saudi Arabian oil in terms of extraction costs. However, the global market price of oil is a major factor in determining the price of gasoline, and American oil production is relatively small compared to global demand. Therefore, even if domestic production increases, it would likely have a limited impact on the global price of oil and the price of gasoline in the US.

This is not a reliable or consistent pattern, and the evidence also shows that there are many other periods where unemployment was below 4% and inflation was not above 4%. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the formula is oversimplified and under-nuanced, and that the theory behind it is not supported by empirical evidence.

However, the evidence provided shows that the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines specific powers of Border Patrol agents, including the ability to board and search for aliens within 100 air miles of the border, but explicitly excludes access to people's homes. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment still protects against unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause, and federal courts can still hold agents accountable for violating people's rights. The Supreme Court's ruling in Egbert v. Boule did not alter the border search exception law in any way, and agents still need to demonstrate probable cause to search a vehicle or dwelling.

According to the evidence, Plan B is a form of emergency contraception that prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg. It does not cause an abortion, which is the termination of an existing pregnancy. The fine print on the box does not support the claim that Plan B causes an abortion, but rather explains that it can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg, which is a different process from abortion. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, confirm that Plan B does not cause abortions and is ineffective after implantation.

However, the claim is also exaggerated, as it implies that the US is the only developed country with restrictive abortion laws, which is not the case.

In fact, some Planned Parenthood clinics are even opening new locations. The claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies that all Planned Parenthood clinics are closing, which is not the case.

In fact, overdose deaths rose again in 2019 and 2020, and the overall trend during Trump's presidency was an increase in overdose deaths. Additionally, the decline in 2018 was not solely due to Trump's administration's efforts, as other factors such as the sudden rise and fall of carfentanil may have contributed to the decline.

However, the claim does not specify that all energy costs are at a 15-year high, and the evidence suggests that not all fuels are at a 15-year high. Additionally, the evidence notes that prices are volatile and have fluctuated within the past 15 years, so it's possible that energy costs may have been higher in certain years within that time span.

However, the claim is also partially true in the sense that the vice president's declassification authority is not as clear-cut as the president's, and there is some debate among experts about the scope of the vice president's declassification powers.

However, the evidence also shows that wages had fallen significantly behind inflation before that, and the recent improvements have not yet fully made up for the losses. Additionally, when adjusted for inflation, wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past two years, meaning that workers' purchasing power has not increased.

However, the claim that the Biden administration has drained the strategic petroleum reserve to its lowest level since 1983 is TRUE, as evidenced by the data on the reserve's weekly stock of crude oil. Additionally, the claim that the administration's only response to the crisis has been to drain the reserve is also TRUE, as the evidence suggests that the administration has taken other actions to address high gas prices, such as releasing oil from the reserve and incentivizing electric car purchases.

While it is true that Wisconsin does not ask people about their income level to qualify for BadgerCare, it is not entirely accurate to say that people can be multimillionaires and still get BadgerCare benefits. According to the evidence, there is an initial check of people's incomes to ensure they fit within the program's requirements before they can enroll in BadgerCare. Additionally, there are external checks to ensure that people's incomes remain below the threshold, and people are required to report any changes in income that could disqualify them from receiving benefits. While it is possible that someone could receive a large influx of money and temporarily qualify for BadgerCare, it is not a guaranteed outcome.

While National Grid, the company that delivers electricity to customers in New York, has expressed concerns about the grid's ability to handle increased demand, the evidence suggests that the grid will require investment and upgrades to meet the state's climate goals. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that the grid cannot handle the increased load at all. The grid has more capacity in some areas and less in others, and the transition will happen over time with investment in the grid and renewable energy projects.

There is no evidence to suggest that Bill Gates' investments in plant-based eggs, poultry, and meat, or his ownership of farmland, are linked to the shortage. In fact, Gates' office has explicitly stated that this claim is false. The evidence also shows that Gates has invested in companies developing artificial or plant-based alternatives to meat, but this is not related to the chicken and egg shortage. Additionally, Gates has spoken positively about the benefits of raising chickens and has invested in farms that specialize in produce, not poultry. Overall, the claim is unfounded and lacks credible evidence to support the connection between Bill Gates and the U.S. chicken and egg shortage."

The first change is intended to increase the government's ability to audit Medicare Advantage plans and recover past overpayments, which could result in reduced profits for private insurers. The second change is an annual update to the rates paid to Medicare Advantage insurers, which will reduce payments to Medicare Advantage insurers. However, the reductions will be offset by other program modifications that are expected to yield a 1% increase in Medicare Advantage spending per person in 2024. While the changes may result in reduced profits for private insurers, it is unclear whether Medicare Advantage enrollees will feel the effects of these changes. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence suggests that the moon lacks liquid water, energy, and nutrients, which are essential for life. Additionally, the moon's surface temperature ranges from 243 degrees above to 279 degrees below zero, making it inhospitable to human life.

While it is true that the Biden administration has made efforts to increase diversity in its appointments, including the federal judiciary, the claim is also misleading and incomplete. The evidence provided shows that the Biden administration has made progress in increasing representation, but it is not the least representative of the American public. The administration has made strides in increasing the number of women, Black women, and other underrepresented groups in its appointments, but it is not the only administration to have done so. Additionally, the claim ignores the historical context of representation in government, where women and Black people were previously excluded from positions of power.

The evidence provided by geophysicists and experts from the US Geological Survey, as well as the lack of any credible evidence to support this claim, strongly suggests that the earthquake was a natural event caused by the movement of tectonic plates. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the earthquake devastated areas far beyond the Kurdish regions, including the world's biggest Kurdish city, Diyarbakir.

    "VERDICT: TRUE\nREASON: The evidence provided by Stanley S. Litow, a public policy professor and innovator in residence at Duke University, and the Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, suggests that having a college degree is associated with significantly higher lifetime earnings compared to those without a college degree. According to the Georgetown study, having a bachelor's degree is worth $2.8 million on average over a lifetime, compared to less than $1 million for those who did not have a high school diploma, resulting in a difference of $1.8 million. Additionally, the Social Security Administration data found that men with bachelor's degrees earned about $900,000 more over a lifetime than men without a bachelor's degree, while women with bachelor's degrees earned about $630,000 more. These findings support the claim that lifetime earnings of someone with a college degree is over a million dollars more than those entering the workforce without one."

The evidence provided supports this claim, citing a study that found a 48% higher rate of degree completion among children who participated in a preschool-to-third grade intervention. However, the evidence also notes that the outcomes in this study are on the high end compared with other academic findings, and that the impact of preschool programs may vary depending on the type and length of enrollment, as well as the racial and socioeconomic background of the students. Additionally, other studies cited in the evidence found smaller but still significant benefits from preschool programs, such as a 12% increase in college attendance and an 18% increase in college attendance.

The proposal is a voluntary program that would allow employers to report tips electronically, and it is not a new tax on waitresses or any other tipped employees. The IRS has also clarified that tip income has always been taxable, and the proposal is not a new audit program targeting waitresses.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden \"cheated on his taxes and got away with it\" is partially true. While it is true that the Bidens used a legal tax strategy to lower their tax bill, which some people have criticized as a \"loophole,\" it is also true that the strategy is legal and has been used by other politicians, including former President Donald Trump. The Bidens' tax strategy, which involved routing income from books and speeches through S corporations, allowed them to avoid paying 3.8% in taxes that fund Medicare, which could have saved them up to $500,000. However, tax experts consider the strategy to be an aggressive interpretation of tax law, and some have questioned whether the amount allocated as compensation to the Bidens was reasonable. The IRS did not take any action against the Bidens, and the couple paid a total of $5.2 million in taxes for the two years in question.

The evidence also states that governors across the nation, including both Democratic and Republican governors, closed schools in their states in March 2020. Additionally, the evidence highlights that the federal government has limited say in what decisions governors or education chiefs make about schools, and that the decision-making power on when/how to reopen schools was primarily local.

In fact, most available research suggests that suicidal behavior is reduced when youth have access to gender-affirming care. The evidence presented in the article highlights numerous studies that link access to gender-affirming care with improved mental health outcomes, including reduced instances of suicidal behavior and depression. Additionally, experts in the field of mental health and gender-affirming care have stated that the increase in youth suicide rates is complex and multifaceted, and that growing access to gender-affirming care is not a contributor to the increase. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the risk of suicide among trans youth is higher than the general population, and that supportive families, schools, and communities are associated with lower instances of suicidal thoughts and attempts.

The poll found that 28% of respondents said they were \"very likely\" to have changed their vote, and 25% said they were \"somewhat likely\", which adds up to 53%. However, the poll has several limitations and biases that make it difficult to draw conclusions about the actual impact of the laptop story on the 2020 election. For example, the poll used right-leaning framing of the issue, which may have primed respondents to answer in certain ways. Additionally, the poll did not ask follow-up questions to clarify whether the respondents who said they would change their vote would have switched to Biden or Trump, or whether they would have changed their vote at all. Furthermore, the poll's sample size and demographics may not be representative of the general population.

Marco Rubio signed a 2021 letter that \"supports waivers that would reduce visual track inspections.\" While it is true that Rubio signed a letter in 2021, the letter did not explicitly call for reducing visual track inspections. Instead, it encouraged the Federal Railroad Administration to continue the use of automated track inspection technology and to respond more quickly to the railroad industry's test program and waiver requests. The letter did not advocate for a specific outcome, and it did not explicitly support reducing visual track inspections. However, it did support the industry's requests for waivers that would allow for fewer visual inspections, which could potentially lead to a reduction in visual track inspections. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that a $2 million grant for Georgia's DeKalb County amounts to a \"private takeover of election offices\" is partially true. While the grant is from a nonprofit organization, the Center for Tech and Civic Life, and is not directly from Mark Zuckerberg, the claim implies that the nonprofit will have control over crucial tasks such as in-person or mail-in voting operations. However, the evidence suggests that the nonprofit will not have any say over hiring election workers, buying equipment, operating in-person voting sites, or managing voting by mail, as these tasks are under the discretion of the elected commissioners and election administrators. Additionally, the nonprofit has stated that it will not attempt to influence the outcome of any election and will not touch \"live ballots\" or tabulating equipment. Therefore, while the grant may raise concerns about the role of private funding in elections, it does not constitute a \"private takeover\" of election offices."

The evidence suggests that Trump's performance in the WOW counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington) has been weaker compared to other Republican candidates, such as Mitt Romney in 2012. The data shows a decline in the Republican presidential vote margin in these counties from 2012 to 2020, with Trump's margin falling below 30 percentage points. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that WOW county swing suburban voters do not vote for Trump at all.

However, the evidence suggests that the MyID program was not given to residents before the train derailment, and its purpose is not to track long-term health problems. Instead, it is a program that allows individuals to create online medical profiles and link them to QR codes that can be worn on a device, providing responders with access to the individual's medical information in emergency situations. The program does not have a tracking mechanism and does not measure vital signs.

The photo does show an electric charging station powered by a diesel generator, but it is not representative of the typical or everyday application of electric vehicle charging. The evidence suggests that such diesel-powered EV charging stations are not common and are usually used in niche situations where the grid is down or a particular location is difficult to connect to the power system. Most EV drivers charge their vehicles by plugging in overnight at home or at public charging stations along highways or at businesses, which are typically grid-powered.

The card did not restrict the ability to use the card once a person reached their carbon limit, nor did it have any sinister intentions to control people's lives.

The evidence suggests that chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other contaminants that can cause diseases, and it is regulated by federal and state authorities. The maximum amount of chlorine allowed in tap water is 4 milligrams per liter, which is considered safe for human consumption. However, prolonged exposure to chlorine above the legal limit could lead to eye and nose irritation and stomach discomfort.

However, the claim's wording is slightly misleading, as it implies that the child tax credit was the sole cause of this decline. While the expanded child tax credit did contribute to the decline, other factors, such as the American Rescue Plan's other provisions and the overall economic recovery, also played a role. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the child tax credit's impact was not uniform across all racial and ethnic groups, with Black children still experiencing higher poverty rates than white children. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE, as it is partially accurate but oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to the decline in Black child poverty."

Additionally, the claim that the wind turbine uses 80 gallons of synthetic oil derived from 12,000 gallons of crude oil to operate is unfounded, as the amount of synthetic oil needed varies greatly depending on the turbine's design, and the claim that 12,000 gallons of crude oil are needed to make 80 gallons of synthetic oil seems to have no basis.

According to the evidence, the county removed inactive voters who had not voted in two consecutive federal elections, which is a normal process to maintain the integrity of the voter rolls. The evidence does not suggest that these voters were ineligible to vote due to not meeting basic requirements such as being 18, a U.S. citizen, or a county resident.

The report is counting \"federally declared disasters\" which includes events that have met the cost threshold for a federal disaster declaration, not necessarily events directly caused by climate change. Additionally, the report's use of the term \"climate\" does suggest a link to broader climatological patterns, but it is not explicitly stated that the disasters were caused by climate change.

The photos may not be taken at the same point in a tidal cycle, which means they do not accurately represent the average sea level rise. Additionally, NOAA's data from The Battery, which is near the Statue of Liberty, shows a change of 0.95 feet in 100 years, or about 0.114 inches per year.

The rule allows for quarantine and isolation to take place in various settings, including home quarantine, other residential or temporary housing, or quarantine at other locations deemed appropriate by the public health authority. Additionally, the state has not operated camps for people infected with COVID-19, and experts have stated that it won't start.

There is no evidence of a \"final warning\" or a recent statement from the US government threatening to cut off aid to Uganda. The US has expressed concerns about the new anti-homosexuality bill introduced in Uganda and has condemned laws that undermine the rights of LGBTQ people, but there is no indication of a specific threat to cut off aid.

The evidence shows that the state already collects income tax from visiting athletes, and this would continue regardless of whether the Brewers stay or leave. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the Brewers' presence is the sole source of these tax revenues, when in fact, the state collects taxes from athletes in all three top-level professional leagues that have teams in Wisconsin.

The claim implies that Kelly unrecused himself solely to judge the case, which is not supported by the evidence. Kelly's decision to unrecuse himself was likely due to the fact that the case was still pending when he left the court, and he wanted to ensure that the case was resolved.

The claim implies that Bragg has downgraded over 50% of all felonies, whereas the evidence only provides data on the percentage of felony cases that were downgraded, not the total number of felonies.

The evidence cites a study that found a 129 times higher risk of death from overdose during this period compared to the general public. While the study's authors note limitations in their methodology and data, the evidence suggests that the claim is supported by the available data.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines shedding as the release or discharge of vaccine components, which can only occur with live weakened virus vaccines, not mRNA vaccines. Additionally, experts such as Dr. Shruti Gohil and Dr. Paul Offit have stated that there is no biological mechanism for mRNA vaccine side effects or vaccine components to shed to others.

However, the gross federal debt, which includes the debt the government owes itself, has been above 100% of GDP for the past decade, including during Pence's vice presidency.

While Trump did encourage governors to shut down certain businesses and activities, he did not explicitly instruct all governors to shut down. The evidence shows that Trump's guidelines and recommendations were inconsistent, and he sometimes gave governors the authority to make their own decisions. Additionally, some governors chose to keep their states open, while others chose to shut down.

The study's lead author has also stated that the claim distorts her research. Additionally, other experts have reviewed the study and found it to be flawed. In contrast, numerous other studies have found that medication abortion is safe and effective, with a very low rate of major complications.

Tuberville's office has clarified that he does not object to existing federal statute and longstanding Defense Department policy that provides for abortion in narrow circumstances.

Additionally, 15 states have laws that prohibit the possession, manufacture, or sale of all machine guns, including those that are possessed, manufactured, or sold in compliance with federal law.

Health experts have criticized the report, stating that it presents no evidence to prove COVID-19 vaccines caused the excess deaths and that the vaccines' safety is best measured by randomized, controlled trials, which have consistently found that the vaccines are safe and effective.

Similarly, some states with restrictive gun laws have high rates of gun homicide, and some with permissive laws have low rates. The evidence suggests that there is no simple correlation between gun laws and gun homicide rates, and that other factors such as poverty rates, trauma care resources, and historical-cultural factors also play a significant role.

Trump was not taken into custody or detained, and his indictment was based on specific legal charges related to a payment to Daniels, not because of his political beliefs.

According to the evidence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not collect data on which drugs or narcotics cause the most fatalities nationwide, but rather categorizes fentanyl deaths under the broader category of \"other synthetic narcotics.\" However, the CDC's data shows that fentanyl compromises about 90% of the deaths in that category. Additionally, the Washington Post's analysis found that in 2021, fentanyl was the leading cause of death for Americans 18-49, with COVID-19 being the second-leading cause. However, the CDC's data also shows that the leading cause of death for the 18-45 age group is actually \"Accidents (unintentional injuries),\" with \"unintentional drug overdoses\" being the largest proportion, and \"synthetic narcotics\" being the No. 1 category.

According to the evidence, Florida has a low tax burden compared to other states, and various organizations, such as the Federation of Tax Administrators, Florida TaxWatch, and USAFacts, have ranked Florida as having a low tax burden. However, the evidence also suggests that the tax burden in Florida is not evenly distributed, with low-income individuals paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to high-income individuals. This is due to Florida's reliance on sales taxes, which is a regressive tax system.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, it is not accurate to attribute the shift solely to \"liberals.\" The evidence suggests that a broad coalition of policymakers, including conservatives like Ronald Reagan, supported the deinstitutionalization of mental health care, driven by a combination of factors including the development of antipsychotic medications, the desire to reduce costs, and a growing recognition of the need for community-based care.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have stated that they have seen no increase in pilot deaths or incapacitations due to COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that the risk of myocarditis is higher from COVID-19 infection than from vaccination. The evidence presented in the article does not support the claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing pilots to die or become incapacitated on flights."

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that Democrats introduced a bill that would ban detaining gay illegal immigrants. However, the evidence shows that the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2023 does not categorically prohibit detaining LGBTQ+ migrants. Instead, it requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide justification for detaining vulnerable persons, including LGBTQ+ individuals, and establishes a \"presumption of release\" for all migrants awaiting removal hearings. This means that while the bill does provide additional protections for LGBTQ+ individuals, it does not ban detaining them altogether. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Social Security is a \"legal Ponzi scheme\" is partially true. On the surface, Social Security does collect money from current workers (new investors) and uses it to pay off obligations to retirees (existing investors), which is similar to a Ponzi scheme. However, there are key differences that distinguish Social Security from a traditional Ponzi scheme. Unlike a Ponzi scheme, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, and the government is required to make good on the money borrowed from the fund with interest. Additionally, participants are aware of how the system operates, and it is not a secret. Therefore, while the comparison is superficially true, it is not entirely accurate to label Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" legal or otherwise."

The Department of Veterans Affairs estimated a 22% cut for fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023 funding, which could translate to 13 million fewer health care appointments for veterans and significant cuts to benefit payments, staffing, and clinic construction. However, it is also true that the bill does not explicitly exempt veterans' programs from cuts, and the House GOP leadership has promised to spare programs that are popular with Republican voters, such as the defense budget and veterans' health services.

The evidence shows that the average U.S. drug price is 2.56 times the price in 32 other OECD countries, and 3.44 times for brand-name drugs. However, the claim's assertion that the difference reaches 10 times more in some cases is not entirely supported by the evidence.

While the bill does not deliver all of what Trump wants, it is not entirely accurate to say that it \"guts everything\" and does not deliver what the people want.

The bill does not give a single person the power to cancel election results, but rather requires the Secretary of State to have \"good cause\" to believe that at least 2% of polling places ran out of usable ballots during voting hours and did not receive supplemental ballots for one or more hours after requesting such ballots. Additionally, the bill only applies to a county with a population of 2.7 million or more, which is Harris County.

The change was approved with bipartisan support and does not increase lawmakers' fixed regular salary. While it is possible that some lawmakers may receive reimbursements of $30,000 or more, this is not a guarantee and depends on individual circumstances. Additionally, the change does not circumvent the Constitution, as it is not a law that varies the compensation for the services of Senators and Representatives. The 27th Amendment, which prohibits changes to congressional compensation from taking effect until after an election, does not apply to this change.

According to the evidence, the Affordable Care Act does have a provision related to rebates, known as the medical loss ratio (MLR), which requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80% of their premium dollars on medical care and quality improvements. If they do not meet this target, they must issue rebates to their customers. The evidence states that an estimated $1.1 billion will be paid in rebates this year, which is in line with the previous year's rebates. However, the evidence also notes that most enrollees will not receive a rebate check because most insurance plans fall within the limits set by the law. Additionally, the rebates are not necessarily a windfall for consumers, as they can be used by employers to offset employees' share of the cost of health coverage or to boost benefits.

The evidence provided shows that while ventilators were used to treat patients with COVID-19, the primary cause of death was COVID-19 itself, not the ventilators. According to Dr. Benjamin Singer, an associate professor of medicine at Northwestern University, patients who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia were more likely to contract a secondary illness, ventilator-associated pneumonia, which contributed to their deaths. However, COVID-19 was the primary cause of death, not the ventilators. The study found that patients who had COVID-19-induced pneumonia were more likely to contract ventilator-associated pneumonia, but the secondary infection was not the primary cause of death.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"There's not been a single book banned in the state of Florida\" is partially false. While it is true that the state of Florida has not created a list of banned books, the evidence suggests that many books have been removed or restricted from school libraries and classrooms due to parental objections. The article mentions that 175 books were removed from schools, and the Florida Freedom to Read Project reported 357 bans from July to December 2022. Additionally, the article highlights specific examples of books that have been removed or restricted, including \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\", \"And Tango Makes Three\", and \"The Hill We Climb\". While the state has not explicitly banned these books, they have been effectively removed from educational contexts, which can be considered a form of censorship.

Additionally, Trump's administration proposed a plan that would provide a path to citizenship for 1.8 million people, but this plan was not the same as the Goodlatte II bill.

The Trevor Project's data shows that about half of transgender and nonbinary young people have seriously considered suicide in the past year, but this is not related to the presence of transgender athletes in locker rooms. The CDC survey found that teen girls were experiencing record high levels of suicide risk, but this was not attributed to the presence of transgender athletes.

While it is true that younger generations, particularly Gen Z and millennials, have lower levels of patriotism compared to older generations, it is not entirely accurate to say that they are \"no longer proud to be American.\" According to the evidence, 75% of young adults (ages 18-34) are at least \"moderately proud\" to be American, and 25% of people in this age group are \"extremely proud\" to be American. Additionally, while patriotism has been declining among younger generations, it is not nonexistent. The evidence suggests that there are still strong feelings of patriotism among young Americans, but they may be expressed differently or to a lesser extent than in previous generations."

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that the bill charges parents with child abuse for refusing to \"affirm\" their kid's gender identity. However, the evidence suggests that the bill does not charge parents with child abuse for not affirming their child's gender identity. Instead, it adds \"a parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity\" as one of the factors that judges must consider when determining what is in the child's best interest in custody disputes. The bill does not change the definition of child abuse, and refusal to affirm gender identity would not become a crime.

Scott said. However, the claim that \"the average monthly expenses have increased by $500, almost\" is partially false. While economists generally agree that inflation has increased under President Biden, the evidence suggests that the average monthly expenses have increased by around $493, not $500, and this figure is based on a specific calculation by Moody's Analytics senior economist Ryan Sweet. Additionally, the evidence highlights that household income is a better metric than individual income for understanding economic well-being, and that the figure Sen.

However, the claim that China is directly sending fentanyl into the US is misleading. According to experts, Chinese drug producers primarily create the chemicals to make fentanyl and send them to Mexican cartels, who then produce and distribute the drug in the US.

According to the evidence, the longest stretch of unemployment below 4% in the past 50 years was actually under Trump's presidency, which was 24 months. Biden's statement is accurate in that the unemployment rate has been below 4% for a long stretch, but it is not the longest stretch in 50 years. The claim is also misleading because it only considers a 50-year time frame, which excludes two earlier periods where unemployment was below 4% for even longer stretches.

I mean I \u2026 We've been having \u2026 you have to also go free market, you have to go capability, you have to do a lot of things. But I'm fine with affirmative action.\" However, this statement is an outlier compared to Trump's presidential record and more recent comments on affirmative action. The evidence also shows that the Trump administration took actions opposing affirmative action, including encouraging higher-education institutions to factor race into admissions decisions, filing lawsuits against universities that used affirmative action, and nominating conservative Supreme Court justices who were part of the majority in the recent cases that overturned affirmative action. Therefore, while Trump did express support for affirmative action at one point, his actions and comments since then suggest that he has changed his stance on the issue."

However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that all four doctors died under suspicious circumstances, which is not the case. Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick and Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, the other two doctors mentioned, did not die under suspicious circumstances and were not targeted for their ideas.

While it is true that some AMC theaters have experienced issues with air conditioning, fire alarms, and other problems during screenings of 'Sound of Freedom', it is not clear if these issues were intentional or if they were isolated incidents. The evidence suggests that the issues were likely due to technical problems rather than a deliberate attempt to deter people from seeing the movie. Additionally, the CEO of AMC and the distributor of the movie have both denied the allegations of sabotage, and the movie has still been successful at the box office.

However, this growth in spending does not necessarily translate to a 50% increase in the number or size of government agencies or infrastructure. The majority of the growth in spending has gone towards entitlements and direct payments, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, rather than expanding the government workforce or infrastructure.

The evidence suggests that there is a shortage of primary care physicians in the United States, with the Association of American Medical Colleges projecting a shortage of up to 48,000 primary care physicians by 2034. Additionally, the Health Resources and Services Administration data shows that 100 million people in the United States live in a geographic area, are part of a targeted population, or are served by a health care facility where there is a shortage of primary care providers. This figure is well within the \"tens of millions\" claim. However, the evidence also suggests that not all of these people may be unable to find a doctor, as some may be able to see nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and some may not need regular primary care. Furthermore, the claim that people must wait months to be seen is also partially true, as the Merritt Hawkins survey found that it took an average of 20.6 days to get an appointment for a physical with a family physician in 2022, although wait times can vary significantly depending on the location.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Under 'Crooked Joe' Biden, there has been a catastrophic increase in shortages of essential medicines\" is partially true, but it is an oversimplification. According to the evidence, drug shortages did increase during Biden's presidency, but the rate of increase was not as high as claimed by Trump. The evidence suggests that the number of active drug shortages increased by 12% during Biden's first 3.5 years in office, compared to a 35% increase during Trump's presidency. Additionally, the evidence highlights that drug shortages are a complex issue that can be caused by various factors, including natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and quality control issues, and that relying solely on domestic production is not a guarantee of a stable supply chain. Therefore, while Biden's presidency has seen an increase in drug shortages, it is not accurate to describe it as a \"catastrophic increase\" or to imply that Biden is solely responsible for the issue."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that doctors in the Netherlands are \"ordered\" to euthanize citizens with autism and other minor disabilities, even if the patient does not currently express any desire to die. However, the evidence provided shows that the Netherlands' euthanasia law does not allow people to be euthanized against their will or force doctors to perform the procedure. The law requires that euthanasia be performed only at the patient's own request, and doctors must report the deaths to the Regional Euthanasia Review Committees, which assess whether the physician who performed the euthanasia has fulfilled the statutory due care criteria. Additionally, the evidence shows that only a small number of people with autism or intellectual disabilities have used the euthanasia law, and most of them had other factors contributing to their suffering. There is no evidence to support the claim that doctors are \"ordered\" to euthanize citizens with autism and other minor disabilities without their consent."

The government has not officially confirmed the existence of alien bodies or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials.

While the National Weather Service statistics show that the number of deaths from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes averaged 194 from 1986 to 2022, and the number of heat deaths was smaller, at about 137 per year over the past two decades, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows higher levels of deaths from heat. The CDC reports that from 1999 to 2010, 8,081 people died in the United States from heat-related deaths, which is 600 to 700 Americans per year. However, the CDC figures on heat deaths are likely an understatement, as many people die of heat-related deaths without heat being officially noted as a cause on their death certificate.

However, when considering the entire duration of Biden's presidency (January 2021 to present), inflation-adjusted wages have not risen, making the claim partially false.

This brings the total to 458 miles, as reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

However, this does not include individuals who are in the U.S. illegally. The law specifically states that people without lawful status are not allowed to become police officers.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: While Governor Ron DeSantis claims to have eliminated critical race theory (CRT) in Florida's K-12 schools, the evidence suggests that CRT was never a standard in Florida K-12 schools to begin with. Educators, school officials, and several Florida public school districts confirm that CRT was not taught in Florida's elementary, middle, or high schools. The Stop WOKE Act, signed into law by DeSantis, prohibits teaching that anyone \"must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\" based on their race as a result of actions by others in the past, but this is not the same as eliminating CRT. The law also bans teaching that anyone is inherently racist or sexist because of their race or sex, which is a key tenet of CRT. Therefore, while DeSantis' claim is partially true in that CRT is not being taught in Florida's K-12 schools, it is also partially false in that CRT was never a standard in these schools to begin with, and the Stop WOKE Act is a broader prohibition on certain topics rather than a direct elimination of CRT."

The indictment details specific actions Trump took to subvert the election results, including pressuring officials to \"find\" more votes, attempting to replace legitimate electors with fake ones, and seeking to enlist the Vice President to alter the election results.

In contrast, during Biden's first 30 months in office, the number of nonfarm jobs increased by 13.2 million, from 143 million to 156.2 million. Trump's statement that he created 4.9 million new jobs during his first 30 months is also incorrect, as the actual number is 5.2 million.

The bill does aim to increase government oversight of pharmacy benefit managers by introducing more transparency and regulation, which could be seen as increasing government control. However, the claim that it is a \"radical health care takeover\" is exaggerated and misleading. The bill's main goals are to increase transparency, require PBMs to pass on rebates to employers, ban \"price spreading,\" and require PBMs to have a process for allowing exceptions to \"step therapy.\" These changes are aimed at improving the functioning of the pharmacy benefit manager industry and reducing costs for consumers, rather than implementing a radical overhaul of the healthcare system.

According to the evidence, wildfires can leave nearby trees and utility poles standing due to various factors such as the way fires spread, the structure of the objects, and the conditions of the environment. The experts cited in the evidence explain that cars have enclosed spaces that retain heat, allowing fires to burn out slowly, while trees and utility poles are less likely to be consumed by flames due to their exposure to the atmosphere and the wind blowing firebrands past them. The evidence also shows that it is common for trees, utility poles, and other isolated features to remain standing even as wildfires destroy other structures in the same area.

However, the claim oversimplifies the progress towards energy independence, which has been a long-term effort spanning over a decade, and ignores the fact that the US still imports a significant amount of crude oil. Additionally, the definition of energy independence is not universally agreed upon, and some experts argue that the US has not truly achieved energy independence as long as it relies on imports to satisfy domestic demand for oil and refined products.

The bill was stalled in the legislature, and Republican legislators ultimately incorporated it into the state budget. While Cooper has expressed opposition to the bill, he has not blocked it.

Additionally, the claim does not provide context about the overall economy, such as the ratio of consumer debt to gross domestic product, which suggests that the debt is becoming smaller compared to the broader economy.

However, it is unclear whether this would affect \"most\" firearms, as the definition of \"most\" is subjective and the number of variables in the bill make it difficult to determine the exact percentage of guns that would be affected.

This means he was not in debt, but rather had a positive net worth. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Kemp cut a deal with Dominion Voting Systems to clear his debts, as the vendor selection process was overseen by his successor, Brad Raffensperger, and not Kemp himself.

The evidence suggests that some companies rely on employees with foreign language skills, and a survey found that adults wish they had studied more foreign languages in college. However, the claim is not entirely true as it oversimplifies the complex issue of foreign language education in the US.

The State Department decided that the conditions were not right for the visit at that time, and the trip was rescheduled for June. While Blinken did meet with Chinese officials in June, the evidence does not support the claim that he went to China immediately after the balloon incident, nor does it suggest that he went \"hat in hand\" or that the meeting was a result of the balloon incident.

The Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, which were implemented to curb inflation, are a significant factor in the increase in mortgage rates. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan, which was passed in 2021, may have contributed to the rise in prices and inflation, but it is not the sole cause. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to the rise in mortgage rates."

Norway and Sweden have guidelines that reserve gender-affirming surgeries for people 18 and older, while Finland and the UK have age restrictions for certain surgeries. The Netherlands has been a gender-affirming care provider since 1972 and has no age restrictions for certain surgeries.

The claim that the Deficit Reduction Act was the last time the national debt was reduced is incorrect.

The evidence provided shows that the average annual income in 1930 was around $4,800, which is equivalent to around $85,000 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation. However, the average annual salary in 2022 is around $56,000, which is lower than the equivalent value in 1930. However, this comparison is flawed because it only considers the income of the top 10% of earners who filed tax returns in 1930, and not the income of all Americans. A more accurate comparison is the personal disposable income per capita, which has grown from $6,836 in 1930 to $45,343 in 2022, a 6.7 times increase. This shows that average real U.S. incomes have improved substantially since 1930."

According to the evidence, West Virginia's unemployment rate did reach a record low under Justice's governorship, but it's unclear how much his policies contributed to this achievement. The evidence suggests that the state's unemployment rate was already trending downward before Justice took office, and the rate has remained low since then. Additionally, the evidence notes that political chief executives cannot claim full credit for economic statistics recorded on their watches, and that factors such as the coronavirus pandemic and national economic trends also played a role in West Virginia's unemployment rate. Therefore, while Justice is correct that West Virginia achieved a record low unemployment rate during his governorship, it's not entirely accurate to attribute this achievement solely to his policies."

The claim is half-true because it is close to the actual figure but not entirely accurate.

Instead, the bill proposes a pilot program to test signature-verification software, and Section 48(d) specifically states that no executed mail-in absentee ballot shall be rejected by the county board of elections for failing any signature verification.

However, the evidence also suggests that the impact is not as limited as the claim suggests, as students taking courses in the affected departments or majors may still be affected, even if their primary major is not being discontinued.

Additionally, Trump has not repeated this statement since 2016 and has not advocated for punishing women who have abortions as a 2024 presidential candidate.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that a discrepancy in the number of ballots and voters in the 2022 general election in New York \u201cappears to be a federal crime\u201d is partially true. The evidence shows that there was a discrepancy between the number of votes cast and the number of voters, with 35,312 more votes cast than voters. However, the claim that this discrepancy is a federal crime is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that the discrepancy is due to the way the voter roll and ballot counts are recorded and updated, rather than any intentional fraud or misconduct. The state Board of Elections explained that the voter roll captures voter history as recorded in a moment in time, while certified results capture all of the ballots cast during a voting period, including early voting and the tabulation of ballots cast by overseas or military voters, or voters who filed an affidavit ballot. Additionally, the evidence shows that the group New York Citizens Audit received the voter file on December 19, 2022, four days after the results were certified, and that the file could reflect the voter roll from three days before the results were certified or even more than a week earlier. Therefore, the claim that the discrepancy is a federal crime is exaggerated and not supported by the evidence."

Additionally, the evidence shows that Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were in accordance with his constitutional duty to count the electoral votes, and that he did not have the authority to condition the certification of the election results on the passage of legislation. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that it would have been highly unlikely for Congress to pass such legislation in the timeframe and under the circumstances described by Ramaswamy.

The accord will prioritize the protection of human rights and encourage member states to incorporate non-discriminatory measures to protect human rights as part of their pandemic response. The WHO's website states that the accord will be coherent with and complementary to existing International Health Regulations and that member states will decide the terms of the accord, including whether any of its provisions will be legally binding on member states.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the two provisions related to Medicare drug purchasing will indeed save the government $161.7 billion over the next 10 years. However, this amount is reduced by $44.3 billion due to other provisions in the law that spend money on expanding Medicare coverage, reducing out-of-pocket costs, and enhancing certain aspects of coverage.

However, the claim that prices \"continue to do so everyday\" is not entirely accurate. The evidence shows that gas prices have fluctuated over time, with prices peaking in June 2022 and then dropping significantly. Additionally, experts suggest that while Biden's policies may have had a marginal effect on gasoline prices, the price of gasoline is largely influenced by global factors such as supply and demand, and is not something a president can significantly control.

However, the evidence also suggests that this increase is partly due to strong revenue growth, driven by factors such as federal aid, population growth, and economic activity. Additionally, the evidence notes that the state's spending growth is not unusual given the growth of the state's economy, which rose by 38.5% from 2017 to 2022.

While it is true that Wisconsin has a documented shortage of OB-GYNs, particularly in rural areas, and that the state's OB-GYN residency programs did report a recent decline in enrollment, the evidence does not explicitly link the decline in enrollment to the repeal of Roe v.

The decline in enrollment may be attributed to other factors, such as the overall decline in medical school graduates applying to residency positions, as reported by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Additionally, the connection between OB-GYN residency programs and abortion is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests, as the programs are required to teach students how to perform a procedure commonly known as a D&C, which is used to diagnose and treat certain uterine conditions or to clear the uterine lining after a miscarriage or an abortion. While some OB-GYNs and residency program directors have expressed concerns about the impact of abortion restrictions on their ability to recruit and retain physicians, the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that the repeal of Roe v.

The Iowa model has specific provisions, such as the prohibition on using data on incumbent legislator addresses, voters' political affiliations, previous election results, and demographic information, which are not present in the GOP's proposal. Additionally, the GOP's proposal allows for a simple majority to approve changes in the third attempt, whereas the Iowa model requires a three-fourths supermajority.

Additionally, the article provides specific examples of CEO compensation packages, including Ford CEO James Farley's 2022 compensation package, which totaled $21 million, compared to the median 2022 salary for Ford workers of $74,691.

While it is true that New York City does spray pesticides to control the spread of West Nile virus, the evidence suggests that the dosing of chemicals used is considered safe for humans and pets. The pesticides used contain pyrethroids or pyrethrins, which are commonly used to spray for mosquitoes in the US and have been shown to be safe for human use at the dosages used in spray trucks. However, it is also true that the pesticides can pose risks if used improperly, and there is some evidence that they may be linked to neurological disorders and cancers in animal studies. Therefore, while the claim is partially true, it is also important to note that the risks associated with the pesticides are low and that the city takes precautions to ensure safe use."

The evidence shows that the continuous enrollment provision, which allowed states to receive extra federal funds for Medicaid, was enacted during Trump's presidency, not Biden's. Additionally, the number of people who are ineligible for Medicaid is estimated to be much lower than 20 million, and it's not clear how many people will be removed from the program as states reevaluate their rolls. The claim is also based on a misunderstanding of the process of removing people from Medicaid, as it's not a simple matter of states \"taking people off\" the program.

The largest year-over-year cut in recent history was a 1.2 percentage point cut in 2013, whereas the proposed budget's largest year-over-year cut would be half a percentage point.

The evidence shows that the industry was already on the path to recovery, with investments and job growth during the Obama administration, and that Trump's tariffs and taxes led to a decline in jobs and production. Additionally, experts and studies have found that the tariffs had a negative impact on the industry, with increased costs and reduced exports.

It is true that the US government has frequently used continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills to fund its operations, especially in recent decades. However, the claim that this is the primary reason for the country's $33 trillion debt is FALSE. According to the evidence, the majority of the federal debt is due to mandatory spending, such as Social Security and Medicare, and interest on the national debt, which are not directly related to continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. The evidence also suggests that discretionary spending, which is the type of spending that is typically funded through continuing resolutions and omnibus bills, accounts for a relatively small portion of the federal budget.

Additionally, experts consider Russia's hypersonic weapons program to be somewhat overhyped, and the U.S. is expected to have a more sophisticated and reliable hypersonic missile capability in the future.

Additionally, the FDA has approved the development and manufacturing specifications for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and the vaccine has met safety and quality control requirements.

The evidence suggests that the money was intended to help states prepare for the increased demand for voting, including in-person voting, and could be used for various expenses such as supplies, staff, and equipment.

While it is true that purchasing Sudafed requires more safeguards than purchasing a gun from a federally licensed dealer in Maine, it is not entirely accurate to say that it is harder to buy Sudafed than an AR-15 in Maine. The evidence suggests that buying Sudafed requires more stringent regulations and restrictions than buying a gun from a federally licensed dealer, but it is still possible to buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer or at a gun show without undergoing the same level of scrutiny as buying Sudafed. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that some states have stricter gun laws than Maine, making it potentially harder to buy a gun in those states. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also oversimplifies the complexity of gun laws and regulations in Maine."

Additionally, experts have noted that his record does not necessarily equate to supporting the elimination of the program. Johnson's views on Social Security are more nuanced, and he has expressed a desire to reform the program to ensure its long-term solvency, which could involve reducing benefits or increasing the retirement age.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that cutting IRS funding by $14.3 billion would actually increase the deficit by $12.5 billion, despite the savings being used to offset the cost of a new spending measure (aid to Israel). This is because reducing IRS funding would lead to a decrease in revenue collections, which would offset the initial savings.

However, the claim that you can't walk over it is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests that walking over a chalked message is not prohibited, and it is only the intentional erasure or destruction of the message that is restricted.

The law does include an exception for people with nontourist visas or asylees, who can buy one residential property up to two acres that is not on or within 5 miles of a military installation. While the law does not explicitly allow Chinese nationals to buy land within a 20-mile radius of a military base, it does not entirely prohibit it either.

However, the claim that the money was used to \"bankroll radicals like Hezbollah and Hamas\" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and has supported Hamas and Hezbollah in the past, there is no concrete evidence directly tying the released funds to money given to these groups.

The calculation of the number of teachers is also supported by the evidence, using the median district average salary and fringe benefits from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction dashboard.

The court ultimately ruled that voters must apply for indefinitely confined status on an application prescribed by the Elections Commission and that an outbreak or epidemic of a communicable disease in a voter's community does not qualify the voter as indefinitely confined.

Stein's campaign has clarified that he supports the Roe v. Wade framework, which allows for abortion to be legal up to the point of viability, typically around 22-24 weeks of pregnancy.

A geolocation analysis of the video also confirmed it was not filmed at the music festival site.

However, it is still possible to become a poll worker without going through a party, as the mayor, village president, or town board chair can appoint a poll worker \"without regard to party affiliation\" if the party list runs out of names. Additionally, voters can contact their local clerk to learn about applying and become nominated on a nonpartisan basis.

However, the claim is exaggerated and misleading, as it implies that DeSantis was directly involved in a recent deal with a Chinese company, which is not supported by the evidence.

Additionally, certain background checks, such as those for jobs that require fingerprinting, will still be able to access the sealed records.

The law does not explicitly state that women will not be charged, and law professors have noted that the language of the law could be interpreted to include women. However, DeSantis has stated that he does not want to jail women who have abortions, and the 1997 Florida Supreme Court case cited by his office suggests that women cannot be criminally liable for receiving an abortion.

This suggests that she did not oppose the concept of a border wall, but rather the idea that it was the sole solution to the issue of illegal immigration. The claim that Haley \"opposed Trump's travel ban\" is also HALF-TRUE. While Haley initially criticized Trump's initial proposal for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" she later supported subsequent versions of the travel ban that did not single out people based on their religion.

Additionally, the evidence shows that while 245,000 people have been removed by ICE, there have been over 2.5 million removals, returns, and expulsions under the Biden administration.

The evidence provided shows that there is no evidence of a widespread effort by the left to register people in the country illegally to vote. While there have been some cases of noncitizens registering to vote or casting ballots, these instances are rare and often the result of misunderstandings or errors. The evidence also shows that the process of becoming a citizen and gaining the right to vote can take a decade or longer, and that noncitizens who vote can face serious consequences, including deportation or incarceration.

However, this statement was taken out of context and does not mean that she refused to call them criminals.

While Haley did express support for a system that would allow people who are in the US illegally to stay and work, she did not explicitly advocate for amnesty. Her comments were vague and did not provide a clear plan for how she would handle immigration. She also emphasized the importance of deporting immigrants who recently came to the US over those who have lived in the country for a long time, which is a common approach taken by presidents due to limited deportation resources.

However, Steil's office has stated that he does not support the plan and would vote against it. Additionally, the plan would not cut benefits for people in or near retirement, but rather make changes to the benefit formula for those who are not near retirement and are on the higher end of the income scale. The claim is also misleading in its characterization of the plan's effects on Medicare, as it would not cut benefits but rather introduce a \"premium support model\" that would subsidize private plans competing with Medicare.

However, it would not affect current or imminent beneficiaries, including retirees or people nearing retirement. The 82% figure likely refers to the total Americans eligible for Social Security benefits, not the actual number of people who would be affected by Haley's plan.

In fact, the evidence suggests that the boosters have been shown to significantly reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations.

However, when considering both state and local government employees, Florida does not stand alone, and some states with low state government payrolls may shift duties to local governments, effectively reducing the number of workers that show up in the state employee column. Additionally, the state's low ratio of government workers has drawbacks, such as employee shortages and high turnover rates, which can pose safety threats and impact the delivery of services.

According to the evidence, Wisconsin has a significantly higher number of people incarcerated, with 21,332 people in state prisons as of June 2023, compared to Minnesota's 8,274 people. However, the claim is not entirely accurate, as Minnesota's number of incarcerated people is not exactly one-third of Wisconsin's. The evidence shows that Minnesota's number is more than one-third, but not exactly one-third, as claimed. Senator Roys' aide, Jalen Knuteson, also provided information from the Prison Policy Initiative, which listed 8,000 people in Minnesota's state prisons as of May 2023, which is more than one-third of Wisconsin's 20,000 people in state prisons.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that big drug companies charge as little as $7 for an inhaler overseas and nearly $500 for the exact same one here in the US. While it is true that Combivent Respimat costs around $7 in France, the evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. The actual price a patient would pay in the US depends on their insurance plan, location, and pharmacy, and the quoted prices are for cash-paying customers, not those with insurance. Additionally, the prices mentioned in the evidence are for a specific medication, Combivent Respimat, and may not be representative of all inhalers. Furthermore, the evidence also suggests that the prices in the US are influenced by factors such as rebates and lack of generic competition, which are not present in other countries.

The evidence suggests that the Joint Economic Committee Republicans' report did estimate that households must spend an extra $11,434 each year to have the same standard of living as in January 2021. However, the report's methodology and assumptions have been criticized, and the calculation is based on a specific definition of \"household\" that is unclear. Additionally, the report does not account for the fact that the number of people in a household is not specified, which could affect the accuracy of the estimate. Furthermore, the report's conclusion that Biden's policies are solely responsible for the increased costs is also disputed by economists and the Biden administration, who point to other factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and supply-chain constraints as contributing to inflation.

While it is true that these cities have high rates of gun violence, the evidence suggests that subtracting their homicides from the national total would not be enough to move the U.S. to 189th place. According to the evidence, the U.S. gun homicide rate would decrease to 4.5 deaths per 100,000 people, which would put it in 13th place among 43 countries with available data, not 189th.

The evidence shows that Biden does not support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally, and the new Senate bill does not provide a path to citizenship for anyone currently in the country illegally. Additionally, it takes many years for immigrants to become U.S. citizens, and there is no guarantee that immigrants who gain citizenship will vote for Democrats.

However, this metric is different from the more commonly used year-over-year inflation rate, which is around 3%. The Federal Reserve and most economists focus on the year-over-year rate, which is not at the pre-pandemic level of 2%.

It also compels the Homeland Security secretary to use an emergency authority to bar people from requesting asylum if officials record 5,000 encounters a day over seven consecutive days. However, this is not the same as accepting 5,000 people into the U.S. daily. The bill does not allow for the entry of 5,000 illegal immigrants a day, as claimed. Instead, it triggers an emergency authority that changes what happens when people try to cross the border, but does not allow people to just come in without any application of immigration law.

The article cites government statistics showing that a record 18.5 million hectares of land burned from more than 6,500 forest fires, and that climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, duration, size, and timing of extreme wildfires. Additionally, a study by World Weather Attribution found that climate change more than doubled the likelihood of extreme fire weather conditions in Eastern Canada, and made the cumulative severity of Quebec's 2023 fire season at least seven times more likely to occur. While arson was a factor in some fires, it is not the primary cause of the record-breaking wildfire season.

Therefore, the claim is half-true because while there are some crimes where cooperation is permitted, there are also significant barriers to cooperation between state and local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that the Olympic boxing committee \"decided this year that men can box against women in the Olympics.\" However, the evidence provided shows that there is no such decision made by the Olympic boxing committee. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not have an official policy regarding the participation of transgender athletes, and the rules for each sport are made by international groups in each sport. The IOC does not dictate the rules or eligibility requirements for each sport it oversees. The evidence also shows that USA Boxing, the national governing body of Olympic-style boxing in the United States, has its own rules regarding transgender athletes, but these rules do not apply to the Olympic Games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"In Milwaukee, we 'never defunded the police'\" is partially true. While the city did not reduce police funding to reallocate it to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, as defined by the Wikipedia definition of \"defund the police,\" the city did make budget cuts and reductions in police positions. Specifically, the city cut 120 police positions in 2021 and reduced funding from $304 million in 2024 to $280 million in 2022. Additionally, the city has decreased the number of sworn officers from 1,864 in 2019 to 1,645 in 2024. However, the city has also increased funding for police in recent years, with the 2024 budget allocating $304 million, the highest level since 2018. Therefore, while the city did not \"defund\" the police in the classical sense, it did make reductions and changes to police funding and staffing."

The evidence shows that Democrats have removed, returned, or expelled millions of people, including undocumented migrants, and that voting by immigrants in the U.S. illegally carries serious risks. Additionally, the evidence suggests that most immigrants who cross the border illegally are not interested in voting and that fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens is rare and often the result of misunderstandings or errors.

On the other hand, the government has taken various measures to stop the distribution of fentanyl, including increasing funding for border control, seizing large quantities of fentanyl, and proposing legislation to control the production and trafficking of fentanyl.

Trump looked to his left at the audience, where Mercedes and her husband Matt were seated, when he mentioned her name. This was likely a reference to his former colleague and friend, rather than a mistake about his wife's name.

In fact, multiple polls cited in the article show that a majority of Americans do not believe the election was rigged, with some polls showing as low as 30% of respondents believing Biden's win was illegitimate.

While Biden did visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on February 28, 2023, for a physical exam, there is no evidence to suggest that he was rushed to the hospital in an emergency or that his visit was unannounced. According to the evidence, Biden's visit was scheduled and announced in advance, and he was recorded leaving the White House on foot and unassisted, then boarding Marine One, the presidential helicopter, before arriving at the hospital. The claim that the White House press pool was \"stunned\" by the visit is also unfounded, as the pool reports from February 28 support Biden's explanation that he would travel to Walter Reed for his physical. However, it is true that the visit was unusual in that the White House press pool was not informed of the visit in advance, which is typically the case.

Additionally, the evidence also mentions that using a different count of wards that includes wards where no voters live, the average number of votes per ward is 2.9 votes.

However, the evidence also shows that this claim is based on a specific metric that only includes \"returns and removals\" and does not include Title 42 expulsions. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the proportion of returns and removals to encounters has decreased over time, which may affect the overall effectiveness of the administration's deportation efforts.

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because the savings are not immediate and will take several years to materialize. Additionally, not all of the savings will be permanent, as some will be funneled into related provisions that expand access and lower out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries.

The evidence shows that Wisconsin lost 2,300 manufacturing jobs from September 2022 to September 2023, which is a significant reduction, but not 6,000. The claim is partially true. On the other hand, the evidence confirms that Wisconsin did lose 455 dairy farms from January 2023 to January 2024, which is accurate. However, the claim implies that this is solely due to Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence. The decline of dairy farms is a long-term trend fueled by various factors, including global competition, labor issues, and environmental regulations, which have been ongoing for decades.

Instead, the warnings were issued in anticipation of large crowds and potential traffic issues, which could lead to difficulties accessing food, gas, and supplies.

However, the data also shows that native-born workers have still gained jobs, with a net increase of almost 5.7 million workers from February 2021 to February 2024. This means that not all net job creation has gone to foreign-born workers, as Vance claimed. The correct figure is around 47% of jobs created during Biden's presidency went to foreign-born workers, not 100%. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but exaggerates the extent of job creation among foreign-born workers."

This \"golden share\" gives the Chinese government a say in the company's operations and raises concerns about potential influence over ByteDance's global operations, including TikTok. However, the majority of ByteDance is owned by international investors, and the company has repeatedly denied that the Chinese government has any control over its operations or access to user data.

Additionally, the evidence states that the Miami Immigration Court has a backlog of about 290,000 pending cases, which makes up almost 10% of immigration cases in the U.S.\n\nThe claim also states that \"more than 90% of people lose their asylum claims.\" The evidence provided shows that in Miami, asylum claims were denied in about 73% of the 67,000 cases decided since 2000, and the average rejection rate in the 2023-24 fiscal year was 67%. While this is not exactly 90%, it is close enough to be considered TRUE. The evidence also mentions that people detained at the Miami-Krome immigration detention center have a 92% denial rate, which further supports the claim. However, it's worth noting that the denial rate may not be entirely accurate due to the reasons mentioned in the evidence, such as the use of prosecutorial discretion and the fact that asylum cases can be closed for multiple reasons unrelated to the cases' merits. Nevertheless, the overall trend suggests that a significant majority of asylum claims are denied."

While it is true that adverse possession laws allow individuals to claim ownership of a property if they have continuously occupied it without permission for a certain period of time (which varies by state), the claim is misleading because it implies that anyone can simply take over an abandoned house without any legal consequences. In reality, the process of adverse possession is more complex and requires meeting specific conditions, such as paying property taxes and demonstrating good faith in occupying the property. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that some states have laws that criminalize squatting or make it easier for property owners to remove squatters. The claim is also misleading because it does not provide context about the nuances of adverse possession laws, such as the requirement to continuously occupy the property for a certain period of time, the need to demonstrate good faith, and the possibility of criminal charges for trespassing.

The National Guard is providing support due to the expected influx of visitors and the potential for overtaxing local resources, which is a common scenario for large events.

However, the claim that immigration is the primary cause of this problem is not supported by the evidence. In fact, the evidence suggests that immigration could actually help to improve the fiscal sustainability of Social Security by increasing the number of workers paying into the system. The claim also ignores the fact that immigrants who are legally qualified to work can receive Social Security retirement benefits after they've worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years, and that many immigrants will pay into the system for much longer than 10 years before drawing benefits.

The evidence also notes that this is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by the system, surpassing previous instances of famine in Somalia and South Sudan.

The article mentions that larger companies have paid for appeals bonds of $1 billion or more, and that a judgment of this size is more common in cases involving large or multinational corporations. However, it is also true that securing a bond of this size can be challenging, as the article notes that companies are generally unable to guarantee bonds that large, and that Trump's attorneys have been unable to secure a bond to cover the judgment.

According to the evidence, the average out-of-pocket cost for insulin was $452 a year, not a month, and the average monthly cost was likely lower than $400. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the cost of insulin varied depending on individual circumstances, such as whether the beneficiary had met their deductible or was in a different phase of the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

Experts have pointed out that the context and motivations behind the seizure are different, and it is not a general move against private property.

The fact that Easter happened to fall on the same day this year is simply a coincidence. While President Biden did release a statement on Easter Sunday, it was not specifically to mark Transgender Day of Visibility, but rather to acknowledge and celebrate the holiday. Additionally, his administration has acknowledged Transgender Day of Visibility by proclamation every year since he was elected, so it's not a one-time event.

However, the claim also implies that the GOP has failed to invest in the campuses, which is partially true.

However, this figure does not account for care that was paid out of pocket or through private insurance. Additionally, the claim implies that all uncompensated care for immigrants in the country illegally falls entirely on the state's taxpayers, which is not accurate. In reality, many immigrants in the country illegally pay taxes, including federal, state, and local taxes, which helps to cover the cost of uncompensated care. Furthermore, the claim does not account for the fact that immigrants in the country illegally are ineligible for federally funded programs such as Medicare, but they can have private insurance through employers or pay for care out of pocket.

Evers did veto a bill created by Republicans that outlined how the $125 million trust fund should be spent. However, the claim implies that Evers vetoed the bill solely to ask the GOP to release the money without a plan, which is not entirely accurate. Evers has repeatedly asked the Legislature to release the money, and his administration has submitted draft plans to the Joint Finance Committee outlining how the money could be spent without further legislation. The veto was likely due to disagreements over the specific provisions in the bill, rather than a desire to withhold the money without a plan."

The study cited by Vice President Harris found that 76% of shooters obtained their guns from homes, but only 48% of those guns were considered \"accessible\" or \"not secured in a meaningful way\". Additionally, the study's definition of \"unsecured\" is not universally agreed upon, and some experts argue that the standard for safe and secure storage is that unauthorized or at-risk people cannot access the firearms.

In fact, the evidence suggests that some Senate Democrats have voted against measures that would allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. Additionally, the evidence provided shows that the claim is based on a misunderstanding of the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, which does not allow for unlimited abortions up to the moment of birth. The act protects the right to an abortion up until the point of fetal viability, which is roughly reached at 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that point, the legislation protects the right to abortion only when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating healthcare provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient's life or health."

While the Dickey Amendment, which was passed in 1996, was widely interpreted as banning federally funded research related to gun violence, it did not explicitly prohibit research. Instead, it was a provision in an appropriations bill that restricted the use of funds for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from being used to advocate or promote gun control. This provision had a chilling effect on funding for gun research, and federal agencies did not pursue such research. However, in 2018, Congress clarified that the amendment did not ban federally funded gun-related research, and funding for such efforts has been flowing since 2020. Therefore, while the NIH was not explicitly prohibited from researching the cause of mass shootings, the Dickey Amendment did have a significant impact on the availability of funding for such research."

The amendment does not define viability, but it does not mandate abortion until the moment of birth. In fact, the amendment reinstates the restrictions of Roe v. Wade, which provided federally protected abortion access until a fetus is viable. The evidence also suggests that the amendment would not change the definition of viability, which is typically considered to be around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

However, the claim is also partially false because it overlooks the fact that Trump's job loss record was largely due to the global pandemic, which was a once-in-a-century event that affected the entire world. Additionally, the claim does not consider the job loss records of earlier presidents, such as Herbert Hoover, who likely had a worse record due to the Great Depression.

While it is true that Newby removed Judge Elizabeth Thornton Trosch from her role as chief district court judge, it is not entirely accurate to say that she was elected to that position. Trosch was appointed to the position by the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, not elected by voters. Additionally, the claim implies that Newby is removing judges who were elected to their positions, but the evidence suggests that he is only removing judges from leadership roles, not their positions as judges. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

The bill, titled the \"More Opportunities for Moms to Succeed (MOMS) Act\", does not create a national registry of pregnant women. Instead, it establishes a federal website, pregnancy.gov, where users can voluntarily provide their contact information to receive additional resources.

However, this does not mean that Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel. In fact, the evidence also suggests that Biden would continue to provide military aid to Israel, but with certain conditions, such as not supplying certain offensive weapons if Israel launched a full attack on cities in Rafah.

    "[VERDICT]: FALSE  \n[REASON]: The claim that the aurora borealis sightings were a \"fabricated light show\" created by a HAARP experiment is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that the aurora borealis was caused by a rare, powerful geomagnetic storm triggered by the sun, which was predicted well in advance by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The HAARP experiment, which was conducted from May 8 to May 10, was unrelated to the aurora borealis and studied mechanisms for the detection of orbiting space debris, not the creation of artificial auroras. The experiment's spokesperson, Becky Lindsey, explicitly stated that the experiment had nothing to do with the aurora borealis and that the energy HAARP creates is not strong enough to produce the optical display seen during a natural aurora. The evidence also shows that the aurora activity was visible worldwide, including in South Florida, and was not limited to a specific location. Therefore, the claim that the aurora borealis sightings were a \"fabricated light show\" created by HAARP is FALSE."

However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the current rate is the lowest in 50 years, which is not the case. According to the evidence, the 2022 rate is lower than the rates in 1972 and 1974, but not the lowest in 50 years.

Tariffs are a type of tax on imported goods, and they can increase the cost of living for consumers. The evidence suggests that tariffs can disproportionately affect low-income households, who spend a larger fraction of their income on goods, making them a regressive tax.\n\nHowever, the claim that \"President Joe Biden's new tariffs on Chinese goods will 'hit every family'\" is FALSE. While the tariffs will likely increase the cost of living for many Americans, the evidence suggests that the impact will be limited to specific industries and products, and not every family will be affected equally. The tariffs are targeted at specific Chinese goods, such as electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar panels, which are not essential goods for most households. Additionally, many Americans may not purchase these products or may be able to find alternative sources for these goods, reducing the impact of the tariffs. Therefore, the claim that every family will be affected is exaggerated."

The claim also states that over $500 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted preparing for Foxconn, which is partially true.

However, the claim that \"New Yorkers are paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services because of Donald Trump\" is partially false. The evidence suggests that while some high-income New Yorkers may have paid more in federal taxes due to the SALT cap, the average New Yorker actually received a tax cut from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the IRS data showed that New Yorkers paid $3.4 billion less in federal taxes in 2018, the first year affected by the law. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in describing the financial impact of the SALT cap, but partially inaccurate in its assertion that New Yorkers are paying more in taxes and receiving fewer services."

This increase is supported by multiple sources, including the FBI's own data and expert analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice and AH Datalytics. The evidence also suggests that this increase was not solely due to the Trump administration, but rather a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and changing attitudes towards policing.

Joe Biden did approve the pipeline by lifting sanctions on the company overseeing its construction, but this was after the project was already 90% complete. Additionally, Biden did not shut down the US liquified natural gas export capacity, but rather paused approvals of new projects to allow for more thorough reviews of climate impacts.

The Fairness Doctrine was already being reconsidered and eventually rescinded in the late 1980s, and Fox News did not launch until the 1990s.

Additionally, the majority of the tax increases would be borne by the top 1% of taxpayers, and most households earning less than $400,000 would see a decrease or a small increase in taxes.

In fact, they introduced a bill that would have expanded access to birth control by allowing pharmacists to prescribe certain forms of birth control. This suggests that the claim is partially true, as Republicans in Wisconsin did not support a bill that would have codified a right to birth control, but they did not actively target birth control access either.

Human trafficking experts agree that the exemption does not make the policy \"pro-child trafficking.\" The policy aims to reduce the strain on immigration officers and protect children from trafficking, and it does not impact how the government vets the sponsors of unaccompanied children in immigration custody. Additionally, the policy does not exempt children from being trafficked, and it does not make it easier for traffickers to exploit children.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that \"Lower insulin prices were the work of the Trump administration, not 'Crooked Joe Biden. He had NOTHING to do with it'\" is partially true. The Trump administration did establish a voluntary program to lower insulin costs for some Medicare patients, which began on January 1, 2021, and ran through December 31, 2023. This program capped monthly out-of-pocket insulin copay costs at $35 or less for at least one insulin product of each dosage and type. However, the claim that Biden had \"NOTHING to do with it\" is false. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by Biden in August 2022, went further than the Trump administration's program by mandating that all Medicare drug programs cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $35 per month, including those in Medicare Part B, and applying the cap to all insulin products a given Medicare plan covers, not just a subset. The Inflation Reduction Act's provisions took effect on January 1, 2023, for Part D plans and July 1, 2023, for Part B. The law also capped total out-of-pocket prescription costs at $2,000 annually for people with Medicare drug plans starting in 2025.

The bill's provisions do not explicitly allow for abortions at the moment of birth, and experts have clarified that the bill would not permit such a practice.

The evidence shows that the FBI changed its data collection method in 2021, which resulted in a lower response rate, but this issue was addressed in 2022 and subsequent years. The FBI estimates crime patterns for missing cities using data from cities of similar size, and the general patterns for the FBI's 2021 figures align with data collected independently of the FBI. Additionally, the FBI reports that the issue of low response rates is a one-time issue that hasn't been repeated since 2021. The evidence also shows that major cities like New York and Los Angeles have submitted data in recent years, and the FBI's data has generally tracked the patterns in data compiled by other groups. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

According to the evidence, Trump did provide Javelin antiarmor missiles to Ukraine, which were used in the early days of the war. However, the claim also implies that Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to send these weapons, which is not entirely accurate. While Obama did reject Ukraine's request for Javelin missiles in 2014, Biden did provide significant military aid to Ukraine during his presidency, including Javelin missiles, after Russia's invasion in 2022.

The bill only prohibits school districts from forcing staff to notify parents about students' gender identity or sexual orientation without the students' permission, and requires schools to provide resources for LGBTQ+ students and their families. The bill does not give schools the authority to transition students without parental knowledge or consent. Additionally, the bill's provisions are meant to create a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ students, not to allow schools to transition students without their consent.

Trump did not send the National Guard, but the governor, Tony Evers, did activate the National Guard on August 24, 2020, less than 24 hours after the shooting. However, Trump did have a conversation with Evers on August 25, 2020, and the White House did offer federal troops from the Department of Homeland Security, which Evers accepted. Additionally, Trump's claim that he was responsible for sending the National Guard is exaggerated, as the process of activating the National Guard is typically handled by the governor, not the president. The governor-to-governor compact, as described by Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, suggests that the White House's role was more advisory than decisive in the deployment of the National Guard. Therefore, while Trump did have some involvement in the situation, his claim that he \"saved Kenosha\" and the governor wouldn't move is an exaggeration."

Additionally, he has promoted voting by mail in some instances, such as in his 2024 campaign and through his recorded message for the Republican National Committee's early voting campaign. However, he has also made statements expressing concerns about the potential for fraud and has advocated for limiting the use of mail-in ballots.

The number of reported rapes in North Carolina did increase by 53% from 2016 to 2022, according to the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's data. However, this increase is largely attributed to changes in how rape allegations are documented by law enforcement agencies, including the adoption of a new reporting system and an expanded definition of what constitutes rape.

The memo instead instructed immigration officials to consider each case individually and weigh factors such as the gravity of the crime, the harm caused, and the person's criminal record. Additionally, immigration experts and officials have stated that people with serious criminal convictions, including rapists and murderers, are still prioritized for detention and deportation.

Instead, it aims to promote voter registration and voter participation by providing information on how to register to vote, request a vote-by-mail ballot, and cast a ballot in upcoming elections. The order also allows states to request that federal agencies be designated as voter registration agencies, and prohibits civil service employees in the executive branch from engaging in political activity.

The evidence suggests that Black women in the U.S. have consistently experienced higher rates of maternal mortality, typically between two to four times higher, than other demographics, even when controlling for factors such as insurance and income. The CDC's data also shows that the maternal mortality rate for Black women is around three times higher than for non-Hispanic white women. The reasons behind this disparity include a lack of universal health care coverage, no federal guaranteed parental leave policy, and less robust postpartum health care, as well as systemic issues such as discrimination and clinician bias. Overall, the evidence supports the claim that Black women in the U.S. are at a higher risk of maternal mortality than other women."

Hodges or the repeal of the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act. However, the document does promote a traditional definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, and advocates for policies that support faith-based organizations that do not recognize same-sex marriage.

The evidence shows that Brown has made statements supporting exceptions for these circumstances, and his campaign has distanced itself from a 2022 questionnaire that suggested otherwise.

However, the claim that the US is \"energy independent\" is only partially true. While the US is a net exporter of overall energy and petroleum, it still imports a substantial amount of crude oil for domestic use due to the mismatch between the type of crude oil produced in the US and the type of refineries available. Therefore, the US is not completely energy independent, but rather has achieved a level of \"net self-sufficiency\" as described by Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University's Center for Energy Studies.

The evidence provided does not support this claim. While Harris has supported antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people, including gender-affirming care, there is no evidence that she has advocated for forcing doctors to provide medical care against their will. The claim is likely a mischaracterization of the Biden-Harris administration's policies on gender-affirming care, which aim to protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination, including in the healthcare system. The evidence suggests that the administration's policies do not require doctors to provide care that goes against their professional judgment or religious beliefs. Additionally, the claim's use of the term \"chemical castration drugs\" is misleading, as the medications used in gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers, are not intended to cause permanent sterility and are considered reversible.

Trump did offer to send in the National Guard, but it was not necessary because Walz had already activated the National Guard. The evidence also suggests that Walz was in touch with Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman U.S. Army Gen.

While it is true that manufacturing output was declining before the pandemic, it is not accurate to say that the US went into a manufacturing recession. The evidence suggests that manufacturing output was declining, but not to the extent that it would be considered a recession.

Additionally, some experts argue that his proposals would not necessarily result in cuts for beneficiaries, but rather aim to reduce costs for individuals by lowering premiums and out-of-pocket costs. However, the claim is also partially false because Trump's proposals did include some measures that could be characterized as cuts, such as reducing Medicare spending on providers.

She has also identified as Indian, given her Indian mother's heritage, but this does not mean she has \"become\" Black at some point in her life.

Additionally, the video's main point, that immigrants in the U.S. illegally are getting driver's licenses and therefore can vote, is incorrect. Florida does not issue driver's licenses to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and people must be U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections. The video also did not provide any evidence that the people in line were Somalis or immigrants illegally in the U.S. Furthermore, the DMV office in the video was featured in a news report about long wait times, and the people in line were described as black Americans, not Somalis or illegal aliens.

The evidence provided shows that Harris has supported a \"mandatory gun buyback program\" for assault weapons, but this is not the same as supporting the confiscation of all guns.

The system is only for people with working credentials, including team and game-day personnel, vendors, and media, and fans are not included in the policy. The facial authentication technology will be used to grant access to various parts of the stadium, but it's not a universal system for all attendees.

This law reversed a 2003 policy that prohibited issuing licenses to people who were in the country illegally. The law took effect on October 1, 2023, and requires applicants to provide certain documents, such as an unexpired international passport or foreign birth certificate, and pass a written and driving skills test. The evidence does not support the claim that Walz signed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants in the sense that it does not provide licenses to individuals without any documentation or proof of residency.

The program is not entirely \"free\" as it is need-based and students must meet certain conditions to qualify. Additionally, the program is not exclusively for illegal immigrants, as it also covers students who are eligible for the Minnesota Dream Act, which includes students who attended a Minnesota high school for at least three years and graduated or received a GED certificate in Minnesota, regardless of their immigration status.

However, the evidence also shows that the difference shrank by almost half in 2022, with about two times as many Minnesotans moving to Florida than the inverse.

However, the rate was still lower than it was during the final year of his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Additionally, the violent crime rate had been declining since the 1990s, and the 2020 spike was largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and other unusual factors, rather than solely to Trump's presidency.

However, the evidence suggests that the Minnesota Department of Health used a scoring system that factored in race as a proxy for increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, not as a means of racial discrimination. The system was in place for a short period of time and was used to ensure that individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, who were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, received equitable access to the treatments. The evidence does not support the claim that white individuals were discriminated against or that the system led to their deaths. Instead, the system aimed to mitigate the harm caused by systemic racism and ensure that those most at risk received the necessary resources. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

Instead, it leaves it up to the school districts to develop a plan for providing products in restrooms, which could include providing them in girls' bathrooms, unisex bathrooms, or other areas.

The law does not authorize the government to take custody of a child simply because a parent objects to gender-affirming care. Instead, it allows a Minnesota court to issue a temporary custody order with a short-term expiration date in emergency situations, such as when a child is unable to obtain gender-affirming care in another state.

Rogers' work as a sales consultant for AT&T's managed cybersecurity unit and his role as a risk analyst for Nokia's American subsidiary were focused on providing advice and guidance on business and security risks, rather than facilitating Chinese companies' entry into the U.S. market.

Instead, it proposed its own rule with a lower salary threshold, which excluded millions of workers who would have benefited from the Obama rule. This change effectively reduced the number of workers eligible for overtime pay compared to what the Obama rule would have achieved. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that Trump \"cut\" overtime benefits, as the overtime threshold remained at $23,660 after the judge threw out the Obama rule, and Trump's administration only changed the threshold to $35,568, which still left many workers eligible for overtime pay."

While the law does make changes to Medicare Part D, which could potentially increase premiums for some beneficiaries, it also introduces new benefits, such as negotiated drug prices and a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket spending, which will result in lower costs for many Medicare enrollees. The law's changes are complex, and the impact on individual beneficiaries will vary. The claim is misleading because it focuses solely on the potential increase in premiums and ignores the overall benefits of the law."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Kamala Harris wants to give $25,000 to illegal aliens to buy American homes. However, the evidence provided shows that Harris' proposal is actually aimed at providing down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers, including those who are first-generation homeowners. The proposal does not mention illegal aliens or unauthorized noncitizens. The Vance campaign's claim that migrants who entered the U.S. illegally could qualify for the assistance is unfounded and not supported by the evidence.

The claim is based on a misleading connection between Project 2025 and the Republican Study Committee's proposal to raise the retirement age, which is a separate entity.

While he has expressed support for greater local control over public lands and has criticized federal management, he has also emphasized the importance of preserving public lands and has pledged to oppose any federal transfer or sale of public lands. The evidence also suggests that Sheehy's views on public lands are more nuanced and complex than the claim suggests, and that he has not made any statements that would support the claim that he wants to transfer public lands to the ultra-rich.

While the law did not have a significant impact on inflation, the year-over-year inflation rate did decline by more than two-thirds since the bill passed. However, the decline in inflation was largely due to factors such as rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, falling oil prices, and an economic slowdown in China, rather than the law itself. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the law caused prices to skyrocket, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence shows that prices did rise, but at a slower rate than wages, and the inflation rate has been declining since the law's passage.

Economists across the ideological spectrum, including those from the American Action Forum and the Center for Economic and Policy Research, rejected Trump's allegation that the administration was cooking the books. The BLS is a reputable agency with a history of producing accurate data, and the process of recalibration is well-defined and has been used for years.

While Trump has proposed a tariff strategy that would increase prices on middle-class families, the exact amount of the impact varies widely depending on the study. The American Action Forum estimates that the proposed tariff policy changes would result in annual additional costs per household of $3,650 to $4,300, which aligns with Harris' statement. However, other studies, such as the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimate the impact to be significantly lower, at around $1,800.

While it is true that corporate profits have risen faster than inflation, and some corporations have increased their prices, the evidence suggests that this is not the sole cause of rising prices. Many factors contribute to rising consumer prices, including rising production costs, supply chain disruptions, and changes in consumer behavior. Additionally, some economists argue that corporate profit-taking is not the primary driver of inflation, and that companies set prices based on demand rather than solely to increase profits. While some corporations may be taking advantage of market conditions to increase their profits, there is no evidence to support the claim that widespread \"scheming\" is driving up consumer prices across the economy."

The law did not increase taxes on families making less than $75,000 a year. The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis cited in the evidence also shows an increased tax burden in every bracket, but this analysis did not include other money-saving provisions in the law. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center also found that any tax change affecting the bottom 80% of taxpayers is extremely small. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

However, the claim is incomplete and misleading because it does not provide the full context. The NCVS data only covers a specific 18-month period, and other sources, such as the FBI data, show a decline in violent crime since Trump left office. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that the NCVS methodology differs from the FBI's, which may affect the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, the claim is also based on outdated data, as the most recent official full-year FBI data covers 2022, and newer data shows crime decreasing.

The IRS planned to hire more workers, but not all in enforcement, and the agency has said it focuses enforcement against large corporations and wealthy taxpayers.

According to the evidence, the tax would only apply to people with a net worth of more than $100 million, and only to the portion of their wealth that is in tradable assets, such as publicly traded stock. Homeowners with non-tradable assets, such as real estate, would not be affected. Additionally, the tax would only be applied after a realized event, such as when the asset is sold.

In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that Kamala Harris' border policies led to a similar number of family separations. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the Trump administration's policy was unique in its scope and impact, with immigration experts stating that it was the only policy that affirmatively resulted in the separation of children from their parents. The claim is also misleading in that it conflates unaccompanied minors with children separated from their parents at the border, which are two distinct categories.

Sen. Casey voted no on a procedural vote about whether to consider an amendment that would have limited foreign exports of oil from the reserve, but he did not vote on the sale itself.

Her proposals, such as price controls, are not communist or Marxist in nature, but rather aimed at making the market more fair and affordable.

The majority of K-12 school funding comes from state and local governments, and the federal government only provides around 8-10% of funding. The plan would reduce this federal share by transitioning some programs to block grants and canceling others, which would result in a reduction in funding for some schools, particularly those that rely heavily on federal funding.

For example, in Texas, about 6,500 potential non-citizens were removed from the voter rolls, and in Virginia, 6,303 non-citizens were removed. Alabama removed 3,251 individuals who were registered to vote but had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security.

The city spokesperson, Karen Graves, stated that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community, and there are no verified instances of immigrants squatting or littering in front of residents' homes or disrupting traffic. Additionally, the claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets and wildlife is unfounded and lacks any concrete evidence. The evidence provided is based on hearsay and unverified claims, and it is not supported by any credible sources. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Vice President Kamala Harris \"cast the tiebreaking votes that caused the worst inflation in American history, costing a typical American family $28,000\" is partially true. While Harris did cast the tiebreaking vote on the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which some economists argue contributed to inflation, the claim that she caused the worst inflation in American history is an exaggeration. The evidence suggests that the pandemic, supply chain shortages, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were the primary drivers of inflation, and the American Rescue Plan was just one factor among many. Additionally, the claim that a typical American family lost $28,000 due to inflation is also an exaggeration, as the actual cost of inflation is estimated to be around 1-4 percentage points, which translates to a smaller amount. Overall, while Harris' vote did contribute to inflation, the claim is an overstatement and should be considered HALF-TRUE."

While the amendment does allow medical marijuana treatment centers to be grandfathered into the recreational marijuana business, it does not eliminate competition or bar companies from entering the market. The amendment also allows the Florida Legislature to issue additional licenses to expand the list of marijuana sellers and distributors. However, the amendment's opponents argue that the grandfathering provision and the lack of a requirement for the state to issue additional licenses could lead to a limited market dominated by a few sellers, which could be seen as a form of monopoly. The amendment's proponents argue that the market will be competitive and that the Florida Legislature has the authority to expand the market if needed.

The Biden administration, on the other hand, implemented the Medicare drug price negotiation policy included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies.

The Defense Department and experts confirm that US service members are serving in areas where hostile actions may occur, and there have been instances of US service members being killed or injured while serving abroad.

The evidence suggests that all states have laws that make it illegal to kill a baby, regardless of whether the baby was just born or is a few months old. Additionally, the claim that governors like Tim Walz repealed legal rights of children born alive after an abortion is also misleading, as the evidence suggests that the law in Minnesota was updated to clarify the medical care for infants who are born alive, rather than repealing any legal rights.

Additionally, the claim that Craig \"tried to raise taxes six times\" is misleading, as the city's final budget exceeded the tax cap in only two instances, and in both cases, the city aldermen passed the budget with a veto-proof majority, making it impossible for Craig to sustain a veto.

Therefore, Brown's votes did not have any impact on transgender athletes competing in girls' sports."

However, the evidence provided shows that the state's voter rolls actually decreased by 1,908 people from January to February, and then increased by 20,250 in April. There is no evidence to support the claim that 78,421 people registered to vote in a single week, let alone that 23,253 of them were dead.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Joyce Craig opposed a bill that would prevent New Hampshire municipalities from becoming sanctuary cities, which is TRUE. However, the evidence also shows that Craig's opposition to the bill was not solely based on her stance on sanctuary cities, but also on concerns about local control, the potential impact on relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities, and the lack of additional funding and training for local police. Additionally, Manchester's policies on immigration cooperation with federal authorities have been in place since 2011, under a Republican mayor, and Craig has not advocated for changing these policies. Therefore, while Craig did oppose the bill, her opposition was not solely focused on preventing New Hampshire from becoming a sanctuary state."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing sector employment fell by 48,000 from its prepandemic peak in January 2019 to February 2020, which is a quarter of the number cited by Kamala Harris. Additionally, the 200,000 figure includes job losses during the pandemic years, not just before the pandemic.

However, the evidence provided shows that the removals were part of a normal voter roll cleanup process, which is required by state and federal laws. The removals were gradual over a period of 20 months, and the majority of the removed registrants were inactive records, including those who had moved out of state, died, or failed to respond to confirmation mailers. There is no evidence to suggest that the removals were done with the intention of influencing the outcome of an election. The North Carolina State Board of Elections and election experts have confirmed that the removals were part of normal list maintenance, and not a \"purge\" or an attempt to disenfranchise eligible voters.

Caterpillar, the other company, did lay off 1,200 workers, but it was due to a combination of factors, including declining sales and production shifts to other countries.

However, the amendment was part of a political tactic and did not have any policy effect, as the federal government already had laws preventing spending on health coverage for migrants in the U.S. illegally.

While the evidence does not explicitly state that the ERA would do so, it does suggest that the ERA could strengthen protections for transgender athletes, including allowing them to compete on teams that align with their gender identity. However, the evidence also suggests that New York state already has laws and regulations in place that allow transgender athletes to compete on teams that align with their gender identity, and that these protections are already part of state law and regulations. Therefore, while the ERA may potentially strengthen these protections, it is not clear that it would necessarily mandate that biological males compete in girls' sports."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Kamala Harris \"let in\" 13,099 convicted murderers, which is partially true. However, the evidence shows that these individuals were not necessarily let in by Kamala Harris or the Biden-Harris administration. The data provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows that the 13,099 individuals were convicted of homicide and are on the agency's nondetained docket, meaning they are not in immigration detention. The data also shows that most of these individuals did not enter the US in the last three and a half years, and many are serving sentences in federal, state, or local law enforcement custody. Additionally, the data does not clarify whether these individuals entered the US illegally or legally, and some may have been convicted of crimes outside of the US. Therefore, while Kamala Harris did not directly \"let in\" these individuals, the claim is partially true in the sense that the Biden-Harris administration has not detained all of these individuals, likely due to the Supreme Court's 2001 ruling that people cannot be detained indefinitely."

Additionally, her campaign and public statements have consistently emphasized the need to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and possession, and she has called for more enforcement and treatment options to address the opioid crisis.

This suggests that while he may believe he should have a say in the decision, he also respects the democratic process and the will of the people. However, it is important to note that Rogers has a history of voting for abortion restrictions and has co-sponsored bills that would outlaw abortion without exceptions for rape or incest, which contradicts his current stance.

Additionally, the article states that the Bidens did travel to Delaware over the weekend following Hurricane Helene's landfall, but it does not mention them lounging on the beach during the storm.

In fact, the White House released a fact sheet detailing the administration's relief efforts, which included approving major disaster declarations, declaring emergency declarations, and providing resources to affected areas. Additionally, Biden directed his team to provide every available resource as fast as possible to the affected communities.

According to the evidence, Americans evacuating Israel on U.S.-chartered planes were asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government prior to departure, which means they were not flown out for free. However, the reimbursement process is structured as a loan, which may have led to the misconception that the flights were free.

Additionally, FEMA has stated that no money is being diverted from disaster response needs, including international or border-related issues, and that disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through a dedicated Disaster Relief Fund.

Additionally, the evidence shows that the Biden-Harris administration did not transfer money from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Shelter and Services Program, and that the program is funded separately from disaster relief efforts. Furthermore, the evidence shows that the Trump administration, not the Biden administration, shifted FEMA funding to address immigration efforts, including transferring $155 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to immigration efforts.

However, the claim is also misleading because it implies that FEMA has prioritized LGBTQ+ people above others, which is not supported by the evidence.

This plan would add an additional $4 trillion to the U.S. debt, and according to a nonpartisan analysis, it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and profitable corporations. The evidence also shows that the tax cuts in the plan would mostly benefit the rich, with households in the top 1% receiving a tax cut of more than $60,000, while households in the bottom 60% would receive an average tax cut of $500 in 2025. Therefore, the claim that Hovde's tax plan would disproportionately advantage the well-off and profitable corporations is TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that Ashlee Adams \"campaigned for Mark Robinson and his radical agenda\" is partially true. While Adams did post a voter's guide on her Facebook page that listed Robinson as the Republican gubernatorial candidate, she claims she did not campaign for him or endorse his agenda. The evidence suggests that the voter's guide was likely created by the Republican Women's Club of Granville County, and not by Adams herself. Additionally, Adams has denied ever campaigning for Robinson or working with him in any capacity. However, the claim is also partially false because it implies that Adams actively supported Robinson's agenda, which is not supported by the evidence. Adams has stated that she does not recall posting the voter's guide and has not endorsed Robinson's views on abortion. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

In fact, the evidence suggests that the wage gap actually widened under Trump. Additionally, the evidence shows that wages for Black Americans and Black men rose even faster under President Biden, with an increase of about 6% and 5.7%, respectively.

The claim is likely based on a misinterpretation of the Tax Foundation report, which actually estimates a tax increase of $2,800 if the 2017 tax law were to expire, but this is not relevant to Harris' plan, which only proposes to end certain provisions of the law for high-income taxpayers.

The claim is inaccurate and misleading. Harris has proposed lifting the income cap beyond which the government stops taxing workers, which would affect working-age taxpayers who earn at least $168,600, not struggling seniors.

According to the evidence, Mandela's team had unsuccessfully tried to find a plane after negotiating with the U.S. government and private charter companies, but the U.S. government did provide support for Mandela's tour in other ways, such as providing security and logistical assistance. Additionally, the plane provided by Trump was not a charitable donation, but rather a business transaction, as Mandela's team rented the plane for $130,000.

However, the claim is also misleading because it does not account for inactive voters, who are still eligible to vote but are slated for cancellation due to inactivity. The evidence suggests that Michigan's voter rolls include inactive voters who are not eligible to vote, which skews the numbers. Additionally, the claim does not consider the fact that Michigan's voter rolls include military and overseas voters living abroad, 16- and 17-year-olds who have preregistered to vote, and individuals who have obtained or updated their driver's license or state ID, which can automatically update their voter registration.

The measure, Proposition 57, allowed people convicted of nonviolent felony offenses to be eligible for parole earlier, but it did not redefine the crimes mentioned in the claim.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Abortion is never medically necessary in the last trimester. Literally never. They just do a C-section\" is partially false. While it is true that C-sections are sometimes performed in the third trimester, it is not always the case that a C-section is the only option or that it is never medically necessary to perform an abortion in the last trimester. The evidence provided shows that there are situations in which an abortion is medically necessary to preserve a woman's health or save her life, even in the third trimester. Additionally, the evidence highlights the complexity of pregnancy and the individualized nature of medical decisions, which means that a one-size-fits-all approach is not applicable. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it oversimplifies the medical reality and does not account for the nuances and complexities of individual cases."

While Trump and Epstein were acquaintances and operated in the same social circles in the 1990s, there is no documented evidence that Trump visited Epstein's private island, Little St. James in the Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly sexually abused underage girls. Trump himself has denied visiting the island, and flight logs show that Trump flew on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s between Palm Beach and New York, but there is no evidence Trump visited the island. Additionally, many other high-profile people, including former President Bill Clinton, were also recorded as guests on Epstein's plane. The claim is likely FALSE."

The evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded and lacks credible evidence. Election officials, experts, and monitoring groups have reported no incidents of compromised election security or evidence of votes being stolen or manipulated. The fluctuations in voter turnout are attributed to natural variations in voter participation, and experts have stated that there is no evidence of fraud or manipulation.

The evidence shows that the election infrastructure is secure, and there is no evidence of malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of the election. The claim is based on speculation and conspiracy theories, and the numbers are not adding up because of the ongoing counting process and the fact that some states still have not certified their results.

The claim is likely based on misinformation and conspiracy theories that have been debunked by fact-checkers and election officials. The evidence also suggests that shifts in vote totals from election to election are normal and do not necessarily indicate fraud.

Additionally, Biden's administration repatriated more people than Trump's administration, with about 3.6 million people repatriated under Biden compared to about 313,000 under Trump.

Some states that do not require voter ID, such as Oregon, use other methods to verify voters' identities, while others, like Washington state, request identification but hold all elections by mail.

However, there is no evidence to suggest that Casey's campaign is trying to count votes from non-citizens. In fact, the evidence suggests that the issue of non-citizens casting ballots did not come up during the review of provisional ballots in several counties, and no one has provided evidence that non-citizens voted in Pennsylvania.

There is no evidence to suggest that the layoffs were specifically due to expected tariffs. In fact, Nissan executives and the company's news release did not mention tariffs as a factor in the layoffs.

According to the evidence, the actual number of private sector jobs created since Governor Hochul took office in August 2021 is 722,100, which is 9,900 fewer than the claimed 732,000. However, the difference is relatively small, and the claim is still generally true in the sense that the state has experienced significant job growth during her tenure.

According to the evidence, FEMA had opened temporary housing units to 13 families in western North Carolina as of Nov. 20, and more than 500 households had been identified for the direct housing program. Additionally, the agency had provided more than 4,950 families with hotel assistance and had approved over 536 households for direct housing as of Dec. 9.

According to the evidence, HIV has no cure as of now, and lenacapavir is only effective in preventing HIV infection and treating those infected, but not curing the disease.

The bill only ended the governor's ability to increase unemployment benefits in the future, not take away existing benefits. Additionally, the state has already allocated over $1 billion in aid relief to Helene victims, and the governor's office has not disputed that the bill leaves the current unemployment benefits untouched.

While the evidence does not directly support the 1% figure, it does suggest that a significant portion of federal employees work remotely. The Federal News Network survey found that 30% of respondents work entirely remotely, and another 64% work a hybrid of in-office and remote. However, the evidence also suggests that the 1% figure is likely an exaggeration, as other surveys by federal agencies have found that a much larger percentage of federal employees work remotely.

The evidence states that Trump's children were born in New York City, and as long as one parent is a US citizen at the time of birth, the child is automatically a US citizen. The evidence also mentions that Trump's children's mothers were US citizens at the time of their births, which would make them eligible for US citizenship.

While it is true that the county is collecting taxes based on the pre-Helene assessments, it is not entirely accurate to say that the assessments no longer apply. According to the evidence, the county is still using the 2021 assessments, which were in place before the hurricane. The county is not waiving or reducing property taxes for Helene-damaged properties, as state law prohibits it from doing so. However, the county is encouraging property owners to report damage to their properties, which will be reflected in the next assessment.

While it is true that some states, like California, may take longer to finish counting ballots due to their laws and procedures, it is not accurate to imply that the vote counting is still ongoing in all areas. The evidence shows that the votes have been counted, the states have certified the results, the Electoral College has voted, and Congress has accepted the results. However, it is also true that some states may still be conducting audits or recounts, and some races may be subject to litigation, which can take time to resolve.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation. While it is true that Wisconsin has a strict voter ID law, which is considered one of the strictest in the country, the evidence also suggests that Wisconsin has some election laws and policies that are more accessible compared to other states. For example, voters can register at the polls the day they go to vote, register to vote online, cast an in-person absentee vote, and drop their completed absentee ballots off in dropboxes. Additionally, Wisconsin's ranking on the \"Cost of Voting Index\" has fluctuated over time, with the state being ranked as the fourth-most-accessible state in the nation in 1996 and the fifth-hardest state to vote in the country in 2024. Therefore, while Wisconsin's voter ID law may make it more difficult for some citizens to vote, it is not entirely accurate to say that Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation."

However, this represents a tiny percentage of California's overall water supply. The state's surface reservoirs can hold more than 40 million acre-feet of water, and the state's groundwater basins can hold between 850 million and 1.3 billion acre-feet.

The evidence also states that the house is not in the burning area and not in an area with an evacuation warning, and is actually 5 miles east of the furthest reaches of the Palisades fire and 1.5 miles from the nearest area with an evacuation warning. This information contradicts the claim that the mansion was completely consumed by fire."

The third scene is traced to a January 10 TikTok video by an \"unusual AI artist\" and is labeled as \"Fake Video, AI Art\". The second scene is also found to be from a video shared on Facebook five months before the fires, showing soccer fans celebrating a team's victory. The only authentic scene in the video is the fourth scene, which shows residents rescuing horses from flames in the Eaton Fire in Altadena, a neighborhood in Los Angeles County.

According to the evidence, the trucks were not held back due to emissions testing, but rather underwent a routine safety check with CAL Fire to ensure the engines were mechanically sound. The safety check did not hinder Oregon's assistance, and the equipment was cleared to continue fighting the fires. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate in stating that Oregon sent firefighting teams to California, but the reason for the delay is incorrect."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"Some of these reservoirs have been dry for 15, 20 years\" is partially true, but it is misleading and exaggerated. While there may be small, local reservoirs that have been shut down for a few years, there is no evidence of any major reservoir in California being dry for 15-20 years. The evidence suggests that most state-managed reservoirs are at or above their historic average storage levels, and experts are not aware of any major reservoir that has been dry for that long. The claim is likely referring to the Santa Ynez reservoir, which was shut down for repairs and was empty for less than a year, not 15 years or more. The claim is also misleading because it implies that the state's reservoirs are generally dry, which is not the case. The state's reservoirs are managed to ensure water supply and flood control, and some reservoirs are intentionally left at low levels or empty for those purposes. Overall, the claim is an exaggeration and is not supported by the evidence."

This means that MPS' tax levy surpassed the City of Milwaukee's tax levy in 2024. However, the claim is not entirely true because it implies that MPS has always had a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee, which is not supported by the evidence.

Prior to that, the mountain was officially known as Mount McKinley from 1917 to 2015. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is accurate that the name Denali has been used by Native Alaskan tribes for a long time, but it is not accurate to say that the mountain has been called Denali for thousands of years in the sense that it was widely recognized or officially used as the mountain's name."

However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that Trump reversed all the cost caps negotiated by Biden, which is not accurate. The evidence shows that the cost savings negotiated by Biden, such as capping insulin costs for Medicare recipients at $35 a month and capping out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients, were signed into law and cannot be reversed by Trump's executive order. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the plans developed by the Biden administration to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug costs had not taken effect before Trump took office, and revoking the executive order did not immediately shut them down.

The evidence suggests that California's contributions to disaster aid are not significantly higher than those of other states, and the federal government does not have a separate, dedicated revenue stream exclusively for disaster aid.

The USDA's policy is to depopulate infected poultry to halt virus transmission and prioritize public health. The evidence also shows that the culling of chickens was not unique to the Biden administration, as it has been done during previous administrations, including the Trump administration.

The Senate analysis also notes that the fiscal impact of repealing the provision cannot be determined because it would be hard to identify exactly how many students would be affected.

Additionally, Kennedy's compensation is not directly tied to the lawsuits themselves, but rather to his work as a consultant referring cases to Wisner Baum. Furthermore, Kennedy has agreed to divest his interest in any litigation related to Gardasil, a vaccine manufactured by Merck, and has not received compensation from Wisner Baum related to any lawsuit against Merck related to Gardasil.

Additionally, Mahomes himself stated that he did not get recruited by Tuberville and credited Kliff Kingsbury for believing in him and giving him a chance. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "[VERDICT]: HALF-TRUE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that Elon Musk \"officially cancelled USAID and fired all the staff\" and that he said \"we just toppled one of the biggest globalist terror organizations in history.\" However, the evidence shows that Musk did not say those exact words. He reposted a quote from Milo Yiannopoulos that said \"By closing USAID, Trump and Musk have toppled the most gigantic global terror organization in history.\" Musk also referred to USAID as a \"ball of worms\" and a \"criminal organization\" on his social media platforms. Additionally, the evidence shows that USAID has not been officially shut down, but rather, the agency has been replaced with a message that says \"all direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave\" except for some employees responsible for critical functions, core leadership, and designated programs. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but also contains some inaccuracies."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that CBS News and \"60 Minutes\" replaced Kamala Harris' interview answers with completely different, and far better, answers taken from another part of the interview. However, the evidence shows that the full, unedited transcript and video of the interview reveal that CBS News took Harris' answers in both videos from the same three-and-a-half-minute exchange on U.S.-Israel relations. The claim is false because it misrepresents what happened. The editing done by CBS News was typical of news outlets, where they edit long interviews into shorter broadcast segments or published stories to make them more concise and informative. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the full, unedited interview transcript shows that Harris' answers in both videos came from the same part of the interview. Additionally, experts from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies have stated that CBS News' edits were reasonable and within journalistic standards."

    "[VERDICT]: FALSE  \n[REASON]: The claim states that \"DOGE has saved taxpayers $64 billion dollars in just 17 days\", but the evidence provided shows that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has not saved the U.S. government $64 billion or more. In fact, DOGE's own website reports a much lower number, not all of which is accounted for. The U.S. Debt Clock website, which is not affiliated with the federal government, also does not explain how it arrived at the $64 billion figure or who is maintaining the site. Additionally, the Department of Government Efficiency's own numbers do not add up, and the website has not accounted for all of the supposed savings. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that Wisconsin does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer. The evidence suggests that while there is no automatic recusal requirement, judges are required to recuse themselves if they have served as a lawyer in the specific lawsuit. This is stated in the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct, which says that a judge should recuse themselves if they \"served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.\" However, the evidence also suggests that there are gray areas and that recusal decisions are not always straightforward. Therefore, the claim is half-true because while it is not entirely accurate to say that Wisconsin does not require judges to recuse at all, it is also not entirely accurate to say that judges are required to recuse simply because they have done legal work in the past as a lawyer."

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that FEMA sent $59M to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants, which is meant for American disaster relief. However, the evidence shows that FEMA did not give money directly to New York hotels; it gave money to New York City, which was part of a program created and funded by Congress using money from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The money was used to provide shelter and services to immigrants, not for luxury hotel rooms. Additionally, the claim is inaccurate and lacks evidence, as Elon Musk did not provide any evidence to support his claim. The New York City's mayor office confirmed that it received $81 million from the federal government, with $19 million going to direct hotel costs, but this was not a direct payment from FEMA. The claim is FALSE."

According to the evidence, the United States does not rank last in education among the 38 OECD member states on any education metric. However, the claim that the United States is \"number one in cost per pupil\" is TRUE. The evidence shows that the United States spends more on education per pupil than the international average, although it is not the highest spender among the 37 OECD countries. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but the ranking of the United States in education is not as bad as claimed."

However, the evidence suggests that the bill would make it more difficult for married people who change their last names to register to vote, but it would not prohibit it outright. The bill requires states to establish a process for individuals to provide additional documentation to establish citizenship if there are discrepancies in their proof of citizenship documents due to a name change. While this process may be cumbersome, it does not necessarily mean that the individual is no longer eligible to vote. Therefore, the claim is half-true."

However, the claim is also partially true because the federal workforce did increase to around 3.02 million during Biden's term, which is a 4.8% increase.

According to the evidence, Joe Ricketts did donate $500,000 to the Republican party, which then transferred nearly $1.7 million to Schimel's campaign. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that Ricketts is solely bankrolling Schimel, as other donors, including ABC Supply owner Diane Hendricks, Uline president Liz Uihlein, and groups backed by Elon Musk, also contributed significant amounts to the campaign. Additionally, the evidence suggests that Schimel encouraged donors to give to the state party, which would then transfer the funds to his campaign, making it difficult to definitively prove that Ricketts' money was specifically intended for Schimel. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

However, the evidence shows that TC Energy, the company behind the project, \"let go\" 1,000 workers in both the US and Canada after Biden revoked the permit, which is a significant reduction in workforce. However, the claim exaggerates the number of job losses and the timing. The evidence does not support the claim that 14,000 workers were fired on day one of Biden's administration. The correct number of job losses is 1,000, and it occurred after the permit was revoked, not on day one. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"I am not making this up: Republicans have introduced legislation to increase your bank fees\" is partially true. The legislation, proposed by Rep. French Hill and Sen. Tim Scott, would repeal a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would cap overdraft fees at $5 per transaction. However, the legislation does not explicitly state that it would increase bank fees. Instead, it would allow banks to continue charging current fees or increase them if they choose. The legislation's supporters argue that it would not increase fees, but rather maintain the status quo. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is accurate that Republicans have introduced legislation related to bank fees, but it is not accurate that the legislation would necessarily increase fees."

There is no credible evidence to suggest that Ukraine started the war. The claim that Ukraine started the war is a false narrative promoted by Putin and Russian officials, which has been widely debunked by scholars, experts, and international organizations. The evidence presented in the article, including quotes from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former US President Donald Trump, and other officials, confirms that Russia was the aggressor in the conflict.

    "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy\" banning cellphones during class time is partially true. According to the evidence, the Department of Public Instruction's survey found that approximately 90% of the districts that participated in the survey (about 320 out of 421) already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place. However, the survey also notes that cellphone policies \"vary significantly\" by school district, and not all districts have a complete ban on cellphones during class time. Some districts allow students to use cellphones in common areas or have exceptions for emergencies or health care. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate, as it implies a uniform policy across all districts, which is not the case."

While the evidence suggests that tax cuts have been a significant contributor to the national debt, it is not entirely accurate to say that they are the single biggest driver. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, tax cuts accounted for $8.4 trillion of the debt, but stimulus spending and annual spending increases also played a significant role. Additionally, while Republican tax cuts were a major factor, they were not the only ones, as some tax cuts were extended or passed with bipartisan support. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but oversimplifies the complexity of the issue."

While it is true that most people are born with either XX or XY chromosomes, it is not entirely accurate to say that these are the only options. The evidence provided shows that there are chromosomal abnormalities that can result in variations such as XXY, XXX, XYY, and others, which can affect a person's sex chromosomes. Additionally, the evidence highlights intersex conditions where a person's anatomy does not fit into male or female, and their chromosomes may not be XX or XY.

    "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim that President Joe Biden's immigration policy was \"a giant voter importation scam\" is FALSE. The evidence provided shows that there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that the Biden administration removed and deported immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and stepped up efforts in 2024 as he ran for reelection. Additionally, it takes several years for immigrants to become citizens, and federal law requires U.S. citizenship to vote in national elections. The claim is also contradicted by experts, including an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, who stated that \"he campaigned as being anti-illegal immigration. He never courted their votes, and he could not court their votes because they cannot vote and do not vote.\" The claim is also refuted by the fact that immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting, and that voting by noncitizens is rare and carries high risks. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that President Biden's immigration policy was a \"giant voter importation scam.\""

The evidence provided shows that the zero votes for Kamala Harris in precinct 35 in Rockland County, New York, are not evidence of hacking or fraud. Instead, the results are attributed to the voting patterns of the predominantly Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish population in the area, who tend to vote as a bloc in support of their rabbis' endorsed candidates. The evidence also shows that Trump won the majority of votes in the precinct and the county, and that the results are consistent with previous elections in the area.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was founded in 1921 and has been conducting audits and investigations since then. Additionally, inspectors general have been conducting audits and investigations since the 1970s, and their findings are publicly available.

While Trump's policies may have had some impact, it is unclear whether they are the primary cause of the improved recruitment numbers. Additionally, the claim is exaggerated, as the evidence shows that the military recruitment numbers were already trending upwards before Trump took office, and the increase is not solely due to his policies.

While Abrams was involved in the coalition, she did not \"head up\" the group and did not receive any of the grant money.

The evidence also shows that during the period when employment returned to its prepandemic peak (June 2022), 22% of job growth came from government jobs, but this is still not 31%.

Additionally, the evidence also shows that part-time jobs increased during the same period, driven by people who wanted to work part-time by choice, not because they couldn't find full-time jobs. Therefore, the claim that \"the number of full-time jobs (was) dropping almost the entire Biden administration\" is FALSE."
