While it is true that gas prices were higher in 2008, the claim is exaggerated. According to the evidence, the national average cost for a gallon of gas in the U.S. was $4.11 in July 2008, which is indeed higher than the current prices. However, the claim also implies that gas prices were higher under Bush's entire presidency, which is not accurate. The evidence shows that gas prices were affected by external factors such as the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 mortgage crisis, which led to a decline in gas prices towards the end of Bush's term. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading."

The evidence does mention protests in Raleigh and Winston, but it does not provide direct evidence that Stein has spoken out about them.

The chart shared on Facebook and used by Sen. Dan Sullivan shows the percentage change in CO2 emissions, which makes it appear as though China and India are leading. However, when looking at the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons, the US and Japan lead.

On the other hand, the US, UK, Germany, and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, which didn't change much over the same period.

The evidence provided does not directly confirm this claim, but it does mention a similar anecdote about Stalin's alleged behavior. The quote attributed to Stalin is also consistent with his authoritarian and manipulative nature. However, the claim is not entirely true because it is not supported by a reliable source, and the evidence provided is anecdotal and lacks concrete proof.

The evidence suggests that low-wage workers, including those who are single and childless, may be taxed into or deeper into poverty due to the federal tax code. According to the evidence, the payroll and federal income taxes paid by low-wage workers can exceed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) they receive, resulting in a net tax burden that pushes them into or deeper into poverty. However, the claim is not entirely accurate as it implies that all low-wage workers who are single and childless are taxed into poverty, which may not be the case for all individuals in this demographic.

However, the evidence suggests that the amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and which years the person was in the military. Those who served from 1957 through 1977 get $300 in additional earnings credit for each calendar quarter in which they received active-duty basic pay, and those who served from 1978 through 2001 get an additional $100 in earnings credit for every $300 in active-duty basic pay up to $1,200 per year. This means that the claim is partially true, but the amount of the additional benefit is not a fixed $1,200 per year. Additionally, the claim states that you have to ask for it and almost no one knows about it, which is also partially true, as the Social Security Administration notes that the additional earnings are credited to the earnings record, not directly to the monthly benefit amount, and that people need to ask for it to receive it.

Additionally, the claim that COVID-19 vaccines are a type of gene therapy is also FALSE. Gene therapy is a process of modifying genes to replace or fix mutations that lead to diseases, whereas COVID-19 vaccines do not modify a person's genes. The evidence provided by PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations confirms that the claim is false. Therefore, the overall verdict is FALSE."

While it is true that Raz Simone was involved in the events in Seattle's police-free protest zone, known as CHOP, the claim is exaggerated and inaccurate. Simone did not \"conquer\" the area, and there is no evidence to support the claim that he handed out guns to form a paramilitary force that murdered three people.

The article states that Medicare Part B premiums have been growing steadily for decades to keep up with rising health spending, and several Medicare experts said the spike in the general inflation rate has little or nothing to do with the Medicare premium increase. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act caps the annual increase in the base beneficiary premium at 6%, which is a standard set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, the claim also implies that the increase in Medicare Part B premiums is a direct result of Biden's policies, which is not supported by the evidence.

The bill requires states to submit plans to the federal government for funding, which includes how they will use the money to expand access to child care and improve the quality of child care providers. This level of federal regulation is not a government takeover, but rather a partnership between the federal government and states to improve the child care system.

The evidence suggests that the cancellation of the pipeline project played little to no role in the current gas prices in the U.S. The main reasons for the increase in gas prices are due to a lack of oil production, global conditions, and disruptions from Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. While the pipeline project would have produced 830,000 barrels of oil per day, it is unlikely that it would have made a significant difference in the current gas prices. Additionally, the claim that the project would have offset what the U.S. imports from Russia is also disputed, as the U.S. imports a small percentage of its oil from Russia.

While the vaccines do not prevent infection, they do prevent the virus from spreading within the body and causing severe illness.

The study mentioned in the evidence acknowledges that the observed symptoms shared by the two conditions do not prove causation and that COVID-19 occurs in regions with little wireless communication. Additionally, the World Health Organization and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection have issued statements dispelling the false link between 5G and COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, the authors of the paper cherry-picked studies that support their claim and underwent a biased peer review process conducted by vocal anti-5G advocates. The evidence also highlights that the ultraviolet waves from the sun are many thousand times higher frequency than 5G, making it more concerning to wear sunscreen outside than using 5G cell phones. Overall, the evidence does not provide sufficient grounds to support the claim that 5G radiation causes the same symptoms as COVID-19."

Additionally, some sources suggest that the increase in wages is not uniform across all groups, with some groups experiencing larger increases than others. Overall, while wages have risen, the evidence does not support the claim that \"working people actually got a raise\" in a straightforward or universally applicable sense."

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim that the Freedom to Vote Act is a \"sprawling takeover of our whole political system\" is partially true. While the bill does aim to expand the federal government's role in setting uniform rules for elections, it does not eliminate the powers of state and local officials. As stated by Rebecca Green, election law professor at William and Mary University, \"State legislatures and state/local election officials would continue to run elections in their state, but would be required to administer certain aspects of elections in a more uniform way.\" This suggests that the bill does not constitute a complete takeover, but rather a more nuanced expansion of federal oversight.

Instead, the CDC clarified that its test does not confuse influenza with SARS-CoV-2, and that the test is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 specifically. The evidence also highlights that the CDC changed its guidance to streamline it with other respiratory viruses, including influenza, but this does not mean that the test cannot differentiate between the two viruses. Furthermore, medical experts stated that most run-of-the-mill COVID-19 tests cannot differentiate between variants, but this is not the same as saying the test cannot differentiate between COVID-19 and the flu. Overall, the claim is FALSE because it misrepresents the CDC's stance on the test's ability to differentiate between COVID-19 and the flu."

The proposed change aimed to reduce the reporting burden on schools and eliminate some data points, including the number of allegations made against a particular school staff member.

The court ruled that a 2019 change to the state's mail-in voting rules was unconstitutional, but this did not impact the 2020 election results.

However, the evidence suggests that the veteran, Thompson, was eventually able to register to vote by mail after jumping through hoops, including providing ID information that matches his registration. The claim is partially true because it is true that Thompson faced difficulties in registering to vote, but it is also partially false because he was ultimately able to register. The claim also implies that the veteran's inability to produce a registration number from the 1950s is the sole reason for his denial, which is not supported by the evidence.

For instance, experts and immigration authorities have rejected DeSantis' claim that unaccompanied children are not vetted, and the administration has exempted children from expulsion. Additionally, the administration has provided information on its policies and procedures, and there is no evidence to support the claim that there is no transparency.

While some critics have raised concerns about the influence of private funding on elections, there is no evidence to support the claim that the grants constituted bribery. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

      "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The evidence suggests that the claim \"Gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S.\" under the Biden administration is false. The evidence shows that the increase in gas prices is due to a lack of oil production, not any actions taken by the Biden administration. The evidence also states that the Biden administration has released oil from the nation's oil stockpiles, which is intended to lower rising energy costs. Additionally, experts and officials have stated that the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, not any actions taken by the Biden administration. The claim is also contradicted by the fact that the U.S. is on pace to produce a record-high amount of domestic oil under the Biden administration.

However, the evidence also notes that the number of permits has been updated and is now 6,653, which is 27% smaller than the initial claim. Additionally, the evidence highlights that companies do not have to immediately begin drilling as their leases last 10 years and can be extended beyond that.

Additionally, the evidence suggests that the state taxes are set on a cents-per-gallon rate, not a percentage of the price per gallon, which means that the percentage of money that consumers pay to the state government for gas taxes falls when gas prices rise. Furthermore, the evidence also mentions that the total taxes paid per gallon, including federal excise tax, local sales tax, and state taxes, is around 67.75 cents, which is not half of every dollar spent on gas.

The grants were part of the Equitable Grant Recovery Program, aimed at supporting organizations that work to eliminate disparities in health, child development, education, and other areas. Additionally, the grants were not the only COVID-19 relief funds allocated by Evers, as he also directed funds to other initiatives such as testing and contact tracing, infrastructure, tourism recovery, and support of small businesses.

The evidence suggests that increased demand, lack of competition, and the complex drug pricing system all contribute to the high prices of insulin. Additionally, the evidence shows that the pharmaceutical industry disagrees with the assessment that manufacturers are reaping the benefits of the price increase, and instead argue that they are forced to raise list prices to provide bigger discounts and rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.

The evidence shows that Ketanji Brown Jackson did not say that child pornography is not as bad if it's viewed online, nor did she give pedophiles lighter sentences. The 2012 report she was summarizing discussed how the amount of child pornography a defendant accesses is not as indicative of the seriousness of the offense as it used to be, due to the widespread availability of such content online. The report suggested that the sentencing guidelines were outdated and failed to differentiate among offenders based on their culpability. Jackson's comments were taken out of context and distorted by right-wing commentators, who falsely claimed that she was defending light sentences for child pornography offenders who view the content online. In reality, Jackson has consistently issued sentences that are below the guidelines and below what prosecutors were seeking, and has shown a pattern of being tough on child pornography offenders.

The claim is also exaggerated, as the number of immigrants who have entered the country during the Biden administration is not necessarily a direct result of the administration's policies, and the administration has taken steps to increase immigration enforcement and deportations. Overall, while the claim is partially true, it is also misleading and exaggerated, and a more nuanced understanding of the issue is needed."

The evidence suggests that the decrease in oil prices has led to a small decrease in gas prices, but the decrease has been slow and not as significant as expected.

The second part of the claim, that Mandel opposed a bill holding Communist China accountable for cheating and stealing American jobs, is also partially true.

According to the fiscal bureau, this would have brought the total gas tax to 42 cents per gallon by April 1, 2022, which is 11.1 cents higher than the current rate of 30.9 cents per gallon. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the gas tax increase would have resulted in a dime increase in fuel prices, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

While it is true that prices have risen during Biden's presidency, the evidence suggests that the increase in prices is not solely due to Biden's spending. The evidence shows that inflation rose under Biden, but it also rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an extraordinary historical occurrence that provoked an aggressive, and temporary, government response. Additionally, the evidence suggests that wages outpaced inflation, and the typical American family has more money in their pockets than they did last year. The claim that prices \"skyrocketed\" is also exaggerated, as the cumulative increase in prices over Biden's presidency was 19.4%, which is a significant increase, but not a \"skyrocketing\" one.

According to the evidence, the Red Cross charges hospitals the costs associated with the recruitment and screening of potential donors, the collection of blood, processing and testing, and labeling, storage, and distribution of blood components. The exact price a hospital pays the Red Cross for a unit of donated blood depends on the price negotiated between the specific hospital and the Red Cross. The evidence does not support the claim that the Red Cross sells blood to hospitals for a fixed price of $150. However, the claim that hospitals charge patients thousands of dollars for a blood transfusion is TRUE, as the evidence suggests that the cost of a transfusion reflects the expenses of procuring the blood itself and the costs for labor, equipment, laboratory tests, and subspecialized medical services required to administer blood to patients.

Disney World contributed more than $780 million in state and local taxes in fiscal year 2021, according to a company disclosure. The $200 million figure seems to be derived from state Rep. Spencer Roach, who stated that Disney had avoided around $200 million in property taxes that surrounding counties could have collected. However, this figure is not a direct result of DeSantis' law, but rather a consequence of the original agreement.

However, this proposal is not specifically linked to Republican politicians or a plan to sunset Social Security and Medicare. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also contains an exaggeration and an unsupported claim."

Wade as a precedent during their confirmation hearings, they did not explicitly state that it was an \"established precedent.\" Gorsuch declined to say whether he thought Roe had been correctly decided, and Barrett did not regard it as a \"superprecedent.\" Kavanaugh did say that Roe was a \"settled precedent\" and that it had been reaffirmed many times, but he also stated that precedent shouldn't always be followed and that he would be open to arguments that a precedent is wrong.

Additionally, the claim implies that Planned Parenthood intentionally targets minority neighborhoods, which is not supported by the evidence. While it is true that Planned Parenthood has a higher proportion of clinics in minority neighborhoods, this is likely due to a combination of factors, including the organization's mission to provide reproductive health services to underserved communities and the historical and ongoing systemic barriers to healthcare access faced by these communities. The claim's association with Margaret Sanger's eugenicist views is also misleading, as Sanger was a champion of birth control and did not support abortion.

According to the evidence, the state Supreme Court, with Beasley writing the majority opinion, ruled that the defendant could not be sent back to death row due to double jeopardy protections. However, the claim omits key context about the case, including that the defendant had already completed his time in prison and the conviction remains in state records. Additionally, the claim exaggerates the effect of the state Supreme Court's ruling, implying that Beasley's decision resulted in the defendant's freedom, when in fact, he remained in prison. The claim also omits important details about the case, such as the fact that the defendant was found guilty of committing a sex offense against a 7-year-old. Therefore, while the claim has an element of truth, it is also misleading and omits key facts, making it HALF-TRUE."

While some Democrats have proposed policies that would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, there is no evidence to suggest that this is their sole or primary electoral strategy. The claim is also exaggerated, as the number of immigrants who would be granted citizenship under these proposals is not tens of millions, but rather millions. Additionally, the claim is based on a flawed assumption that immigrants will automatically vote for Democrats, which is not supported by evidence. Many immigrants who become citizens may not vote for Democrats, and some may not vote at all. The claim is also based on a flawed understanding of the immigration process, which is more complex than simply granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

When unemployment is high, wages tend to be low, and when unemployment is low, wages tend to rise, leading to inflation. However, the evidence also shows that this relationship is not always straightforward and can be influenced by various factors, such as supply chain problems, global events, and economic policies. In recent years, the relationship between unemployment and inflation has been more complex, with wages rising faster than inflation in some periods and inflation rising faster than wages in others.

Additionally, other evidence suggests that mask usage can reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect individuals from the virus.

Additionally, the county officials and election administrators emphasized that these issues were not evidence of fraud, but rather examples of the complexity of the vote-by-mail process and voters' unfamiliarity with some of the intricate details.

The UCLA report mentioned in the evidence states that school segregation is now more severe than in the late 1960s, but it also notes that modern school segregation is not the same as the government-ordered social system that the Supreme Court struck down in 1954. Additionally, the evidence highlights that while there has been an increase in segregation, it is not uniform across all schools and regions, and there are still some schools that are more integrated than others.

This change was not a result of misdiagnosing flu cases as COVID-19. Additionally, the evidence does not support the claim that COVID-19 tests were picking up flu cases and labeling them as COVID-19. The CDC has consistently emphasized the importance of testing and accurate diagnosis throughout the pandemic. The claim that \"they're going to do the same thing with monkeypox and shingles\" is also FALSE, as there is no evidence to support this claim.

However, the claim that forgiveness would give the wealthy a \"financial windfall\" but not really help low-income people is also partially true, as the evidence suggests that the beneficiaries of student loan forgiveness would be higher-income, better-educated, and more likely to be white than low-income individuals. However, the claim is also overstated, as it implies that the majority of student loan debt is held by the wealthy, when in fact, a significant portion of debt is held by households with lower incomes. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that many households have undergraduate debt even though someone in the household also has a graduate degree, which could affect the distribution of debt among income groups.

The evidence suggests that 15% of women in a poll commissioned by the BBC reported experiencing pressure to terminate a pregnancy when they didn't want to, which is a form of reproductive coercion. However, the evidence does not provide a direct link between this 15% and the total number of abortions.

The video shown in the evidence is likely a botfly (Cuterebra ruficus) and not a drone, and the military does not use drones that look and act like flies. Additionally, the military has denied any involvement in releasing genetically modified mosquitoes or using directed-energy weapons that could cause \"pestilence\". The evidence suggests that the reported drone sightings are likely misidentifications of manned aircraft, stars, or other natural phenomena. Therefore, the claim is FALSE."

Additionally, he has not spoken publicly about this issue during his campaign. However, he has indicated support for holding a referendum asking Nevada voters to restrict abortion after 13 weeks of pregnancy, which would be a tighter restriction than under current Nevada law.

The evidence suggests that Nunn did take money from Adventureland's CEO, but the legislation he sponsored was not directly responsible for the child's death. The legislation in question lowered the minimum age for amusement park ride operators from 18 to 16, subject to carnival ride and safety training, which was a response to the amusement park industry's struggle to find workers post-COVID. The child's death occurred in 2021, and the legislation was passed in 2022.

The man was not an armed kidnapper, but rather a defendant who was convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping. Additionally, the claim implies that Beasley's decision to vacate the conviction resulted in the man's early release, which is not accurate. The man had already completed his sentence and was not released early as a result of Beasley's decision. Furthermore, the claim does not provide any evidence that Beasley voted to release a double murderer early.

According to the OECD data, more than a dozen OECD members had a higher inflation rate than the United States' 8.6% in June 2022, including predominantly Baltic and Eastern European nations. However, a larger number of OECD members had inflation rates lower than 8.6%, including all but one member of the G-7 group. The evidence also suggests that the US economy is recovering at a faster pace than many other countries, which has contributed to its higher inflation rate.

However, the claim also states that \"From March 2021 to March 2022, 769 athletes have died or suffered cardiac arrest.\" This is partially false, as the evidence suggests that the 769 figure includes both deaths and cardiac arrest episodes that did not result in death, and also includes reports of cases that did not involve any emergency medical episodes at all.

While border agents do have some unique powers within the 100-mile zone, they are not allowed to enter people's homes without a warrant. The law explicitly excludes access to private dwellings, and the Fourth Amendment still protects against unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause.

While it is true that a default on the debt would be unprecedented in the sense that it would be the first time the US government has failed to pay its debts, it is not entirely accurate to say that a default has never happened before. The evidence suggests that the US has defaulted on its debts in the past, albeit in different forms. For example, the US defaulted on its gold-backed currency in 1971, and there have been instances of the government failing to meet its debt obligations in the past.

However, other evidence suggests that increased access to contraception may not necessarily lead to a decrease in abortion demand, as unintended pregnancies may still occur despite increased access to contraception (e.g., \"A number of studies have demonstrated that as contraception becomes more accessible, the number of unwanted pregnancies actually rises, thus increasing the demand for abortion.\").\n\nOverall, the evidence is mixed, and it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the relationship between contraception availability and abortion demand.

While some experts mention the possibility of a link between wind farm sounds and whale deaths, there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim. In fact, government and private experts have stated that there is no evidence to support the claim that whales are being killed by sounds emitted during underwater surveying ahead of wind farm construction. Additionally, experts have pointed out that whales can tolerate significant sound disturbances, such as underwater explosions and drilling, and that the sounds emitted during wind farm construction are not likely to cause harm. Therefore, the claim that wind farm construction is a possible cause of dead whales washing ashore in New Jersey is FALSE."

The evidence shows that the current scientific consensus is that humans do cause climate change, and that it is a result of human changes to the atmosphere. Additionally, experts such as Ronald Amundson and Alan Buis explicitly state that human-driven climate change has no natural cause and is a result of human activities. The claim that magnetic pole shifting is causing havoc worldwide in weather, climate, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. is also disputed among scientists, with some experts stating that there is little scientific evidence of any significant link between Earth's drifting magnetic poles and climate.

However, the claim is not entirely true as American figures, such as Walter Camp, also played a significant role in shaping the modern version of the game.

However, the accord would not give the WHO authority over US pandemic policies, as it would be a collaborative effort between member states, with each country maintaining its sovereignty and national laws and regulations.

Additionally, there is no recent evidence of the US issuing a warning to Uganda to legalize homosexuality or face the loss of aid. The US has expressed concerns about the new anti-homosexuality bill introduced in Uganda and has called on the government to veto it, but there is no indication of a \"final warning\" being given.

In fact, the evidence suggests that Zelenskyy has expressed concerns about the potential loss of life and has emphasized the importance of international support for Ukraine. The quote provided by Greene is likely a misquote or a fabrication. Zelenskyy's actual statement, as reported by CBS News, is that if Ukraine were to lose, the US would have to send its sons and daughters to war, implying a hypothetical scenario where the US would have to intervene to protect NATO member states, not that he wants American sons and daughters to die in Ukraine.

However, the claim also implies that if the Brewers leave Wisconsin, all player salaries that generate dollars for the state would go away. This is not entirely accurate. The evidence suggests that the state-level taxpayer funds for the stadium would come from the income tax generated from Brewers employees, including players, and visiting players who also pay income taxes when they are in Milwaukee.

The evidence does not support the claim that Kelly \"pocketed\" the contributions or that he unrecused himself solely to judge the case.

Additionally, the claim implies that the lack of warming in Antarctica is evidence against human-driven climate change, which is not supported by the scientific consensus. The evidence provided in the article does not provide a clear explanation for the discrepancy between the warming of Antarctica and the rest of the planet, and it is not accurate to say that scientists are struggling to understand this phenomenon.

Emily Caffrey, a health physics assistant professor, explicitly states that lead paint was banned because of its chemical toxicity, and experts agree that it would not block most radiation due to the insufficient amount of lead in the paint.

While the evidence suggests that the homeownership rate for Black households has increased from 42% in 1970 to 44% in 2022, which is a small increase of 0.4% over 10 years, it is not entirely accurate to say that the rate has remained \"relatively unchanged\" since 1968. The evidence also highlights that there have been significant disparities in homeownership rates between Black and white Americans, with white Americans having a 72.7% homeownership rate in 2022, compared to 44% for Black Americans. Additionally, the evidence mentions that Black homeowners derive fewer benefits from mortgage interest deductions and that Black-owned homes tend to be in communities where houses don't appreciate as much, which may contribute to the persistent homeownership gap.

While it is true that fentanyl is a significant contributor to the opioid epidemic in the United States, and that China is a major source of fentanyl, the claim that China directly sends fentanyl into the US and is responsible for 80,000 deaths per year is an exaggeration.\n\nAccording to the evidence, China was the primary source of illicit fentanyl early in the US opioid epidemic, but when the Chinese government banned the production of fentanyl in 2019, producers switched to selling chemicals used in the production of fentanyl. Additionally, Chinese drug producers primarily create the chemicals to make fentanyl and send it to Mexican cartels, not directly to the US. The claim that China sends fentanyl into the US and is responsible for 80,000 deaths per year is a misleading interpretation of the trafficking of fentanyl into the US.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the claim that fentanyl is killing 80,000 Americans per year is not entirely accurate. While fentanyl is a significant contributor to opioid-related deaths, the evidence suggests that the number of fentanyl-related deaths is lower than 80,000 per year. For example, according to the evidence, fentanyl deaths are on the rise in the US, but the number of deaths is not as high as 80,000 per year.

The evidence suggests that the base pay for military service members is lower than the average full-time pay for fast-food workers in high-paying states, but military service members also receive additional compensation, such as health care, educational programs, and retirement pay, which increases the value of their compensation. Additionally, the claim does not account for the fact that many fast-food workers do not have full-time jobs, and the starting salary for McDonald's employees is lower than the average salary. Therefore, the claim is half-true because it is partially accurate but also misleading and incomplete."

This is supported by multiple sources, including the Insurance Information Institute and Insurify, a national insurance agency.

According to the evidence, it is true that millions of people have crossed the border illegally under the Biden administration, with estimates ranging from 2.4 million to 8 million. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that all of these individuals were given a free cellphone and airline tickets. Some evidence suggests that migrants are given a cellphone and a plane ticket to facilitate their travel, but this is not a universal practice. Additionally, the claim that 7 million people crossed the border illegally is likely an exaggeration, as the actual number of encounters at the border is around 8 million, but not all of these individuals may have crossed illegally.

While Planned Parenthood employees did provide information to undercover actors posing as sex traffickers, the employees also followed protocol and reported the incidents to their supervisors and law enforcement.

However, the claim's assertion that \"tens of millions\" is not entirely accurate, as the evidence only suggests that around 100 million people live in areas with a shortage of primary care providers, not necessarily that all of them cannot find a doctor. Additionally, the claim's statement about people having to wait months to be seen is also not entirely accurate, as the evidence suggests that while wait times can be a problem, it's not necessarily months-long.

For example, the Arizona law that banned ethnic studies in public schools was not specifically targeting Latino or Hispanic studies, and the Texas textbook ban was due to concerns about racism and inaccuracy, not a desire to prevent the teaching of Latino history. Additionally, some states have actually taken steps to promote the teaching of Latino and Hispanic history, such as California's requirement for public high school students to take ethnic studies.

Additionally, the evidence shows that drug shortages have been a long-standing issue in the US, dating back to the Obama administration, and are caused by a variety of factors, including natural disasters, manufacturing problems, and slim profit margins on generic drugs.

The Netherlands' euthanasia law does not allow people to be euthanized against their will, and doctors are not \"ordered\" to perform euthanasia on patients who do not request it. Additionally, the law requires that patients must request euthanasia themselves, and that doctors must be satisfied that the request is voluntary and well-considered. While it is true that some people with autism or intellectual disabilities have used the euthanasia law, this is not because they were \"ordered\" to do so, but rather because they made the decision themselves.

According to the evidence, wages have increased substantially, but less than inflation, resulting in a slight decline in real wages. Additionally, the Great Depression was a period of unprecedented economic downturn, with a decline in gross domestic product of over 30% between 1929 and 1933, which is not comparable to the current economic situation.

While the evidence suggests that Wisconsin's OB-GYN residency programs did report a decline in enrollment, it is unclear whether this decline is directly caused by the repeal of Roe v. Wade. The evidence also suggests that the decline in enrollment may be part of a larger trend, as the number of medical school graduates who applied to residency positions decreased by about 2% nationwide during the 2022-23 application cycle. Additionally, the report from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that the decrease in OB-GYN applicants was highest in states with complete abortion bans, but it is unclear whether this is a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

The evidence suggests that 95% of ibuprofen imports come from China, but this figure does not apply to all over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the evidence also shows that China accounts for a smaller percentage of imports for other active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as 18% in 2019. Furthermore, the U.S. produces a significant amount of pharmaceutical ingredients domestically, and exports some to China.

In fact, the evidence suggests that buying a gun from a licensed dealer in Maine is more complicated than buying Sudafed, as it requires a background check and the information of gun buyers is accessible to law enforcement. However, it is also true that there are some differences in the laws and regulations surrounding the sale of Sudafed and guns, such as the availability of guns in the U.S. and the lack of limits on the number of guns that can be purchased at one time.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve's actions, such as raising interest rates, have also played a significant role in addressing inflation. The claim's assertion that the government's actions had \"nothing to do with getting our economy back in line\" is also disputed by the evidence, as the Federal Reserve's analysis suggests that government spending has contributed to higher inflation in the United States compared to other developed nations.

The Florida law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, makes it a third-degree felony for a doctor to perform or actively participate in an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, punishable by fines and up to five years in prison.

However, it is not entirely accurate because the United States has sometimes sought to establish military bases or maintain a military presence in the countries it has fought wars against. For example, the United States has maintained a military presence in Germany and Japan since the end of World War II, and has established military bases in countries such as South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nAdditionally, the claim is based on a narrow definition of \"land\" that only includes territory that is annexed or occupied, and does not account for other forms of territorial control or influence that the United States may exert. For example, the United States has exerted significant influence over the governments and economies of countries it has fought wars against, and has often played a major role in shaping the post-war order in these countries.\n\nOverall, while the claim is partially true, it is not entirely accurate and oversimplifies the complex and nuanced nature of the United States' military interventions and post-war policies."

The evidence also mentions that some states have longer voting periods, and PolitiFact North Carolina measured the length of time between when absentee ballots are mailed to voters and the final day a ballot can be postmarked.

The evidence suggests that the 8% figure is a theoretical calculation that would apply if the law is changed, rather than the actual tax rate paid by billionaires today. The actual tax rate paid by billionaires is likely higher, with some paying as high as 16% under current law. Additionally, the claim implies that all billionaires pay an average tax rate of 8%, which is not accurate, as some billionaires pay much higher or lower rates depending on their specific circumstances.

Instead, the Republican Party did not have a strong presence in many Southern states, so they did not distribute ballots in those areas. Lincoln's name did not appear on the ballot in many Southern states because the Republican Party did not have a strong organization or voters in those areas. This is supported by quotes from historians and experts, including Louis Masur and Jonathan W. White, who clarify that Lincoln was not removed from the ballot, but rather, his name was not included on the ballot in many states due to the lack of Republican Party presence.

The evidence retrieved suggests that Kohl's has indeed contributed $1 million to five Milwaukee-area nonprofit organizations, which are related to the Black Lives Matter movement. However, it is important to note that the Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized global network, and it is not a single entity that can receive donations. The Claremont Institute's definition of \"Black Lives Matter related causes\" includes organizations and initiatives that advance one or more aspects of BLM's agenda, which may not necessarily be directly affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Therefore, while Kohl's has contributed to organizations related to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is not clear whether the exact $1 million was donated to the Black Lives Matter movement itself. As such, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

According to the evidence, support for Roe peaked in 2006 at 66%, and while it has increased since then, it has not surpassed that level.

The cap only applies after the beneficiary crosses the $2,000 annual threshold, and the plan pays the majority of the remaining cost, while Medicare and the drugmaker also share some of the cost.

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim \"China's in a situation where they have more retired than working\" is partially true. According to the evidence, China's population is aging rapidly, and the ratio of working-age people to retirees is expected to decline. By 2040, the ratio is projected to fall below 2-to-1, and by 2081, it is expected to be below 1-to-1. This indicates that China will have fewer working-age people to support its retired population. However, the claim is not entirely accurate, as China still has a relatively high ratio of working-age people to retirees compared to other countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the evidence suggests that China's economic growth rate is still higher than that of the United States, which may mitigate the impact of its aging population.

The existing law already allows for exceptions for members of societies that use masks, hoods, or disguises as part of a \"parade, ritual, initiation, ceremony, or celebration.\" The bill does not change this provision, and the KKK would still need to obtain permission from the municipality or County Commissioners to wear hoods or masks in public.

Additionally, Biden did approve the project, but only after the pipeline was already largely complete. The claim that Biden \"shut down\" U.S. liquified natural gas export capacity is also partially true, as Biden paused new permits for LNG export projects to allow for more thorough reviews of their climate impacts.

The evidence shows that the rate of reported rapes in North Carolina increased from 24 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 32.1 in 2019, which is a 33.7% increase, not 53%. Additionally, the evidence suggests that the increase in reported rapes is partly due to the expanded definition of rape and the increased willingness of victims to come forward, rather than an actual increase in the number of rapes.

The guidance document noted that race and ethnicity could put individual patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, but it was not the only consideration. Other factors such as age, medical conditions, and underlying health conditions were also taken into account. Additionally, the program was designed to ensure equitable distribution of treatments based on clinical need, and it did not discriminate against white people. The claim that being non-white gave a person more priority than having hypertension or other risk factors is also exaggerated and not supported by the evidence.

While it is true that Kamala Harris did cast the tiebreaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which included funding for 86,852 new full-time equivalent positions at the IRS, the claim is misleading and exaggerated. The funding was not specifically for hiring agents to go after tip income, but rather for expanding the IRS workforce to improve tax compliance and enforcement. Additionally, the claim implies that the new hires would be targeting tip income, which is not accurate. The IRS has always required workers to report their tips as income, and the new funding is intended to improve the agency's ability to collect taxes owed, not to target specific types of income.

The plan is aimed at taxing the wealthy, and it would apply to households with incomes above $400,000. The tax would be on the unrealized gains, not on the property itself.

Many experts, including economists and studies, argue that tariffs ultimately hurt consumers by raising prices and distorting the market, and that the benefits of higher wages are often outweighed by the costs to consumers.

The claim's statement that \"without definitions these words can mean almost anything\" is an exaggeration, as the evidence shows that words like \"abortion,\" \"health care provider,\" and others have understood meanings in ordinary usage. Therefore, the claim is half-true, as it is partially accurate but also contains an exaggeration."

However, the evidence provided shows that President Biden was not lounging on the beach during the hurricane. According to the evidence, the Bidens departed Washington, D.C. on September 27 and traveled to Delaware over the weekend following Hurricane Helene's landfall, and they visited the same Rehoboth Beach area, where they own a home. This suggests that they were not on the beach during the hurricane.

The evidence suggests that Biden has provided multiple packages of military assistance to Ukraine, but the exact amount is not specified. Additionally, the claim is false regarding Hurricane Helene, as the evidence shows that Biden did not announce \"no more aid\" for the hurricane, but rather, the administration did declare major disaster declarations and provided aid for the affected areas.

However, the evidence also shows that Americans in Israel were offered chartered flights to leave the country, but they were asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government prior to departure. This means that the claim is partially true, as Americans in Lebanon are being offered loans to pay for flights, while Americans in Israel were not being offered free flights, but were instead asked to repay the U.S. government. The claim's assertion that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year \"on our dime\" is also partially true, as the U.S. government has been providing aid to Israel's military, but the evidence does not specifically state that the U.S. government has been paying for chartered flights for Israeli citizens.

While it is true that Trump did provide a plane for Mandela's travel, it was not a charitable donation. Instead, it was a $130,000 business transaction, as Mandela's team contacted Trump asking to rent his private jet, and Trump offered one of his Boeing 727 commercial planes. The U.S. government did provide some support for Mandela's travel, including security and logistical assistance.

According to the evidence, Michigan has 8,441,536 registered voters, but the number of eligible voters is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the number of registered voters includes inactive voters, which means that the actual number of eligible voters is likely lower. Additionally, the evidence suggests that some noncitizens may be registered to vote due to misunderstandings or errors, which could contribute to the discrepancy between registered voters and eligible citizens. However, the claim's assertion that this creates a \"huge risk of election fraud\" is not supported by the evidence, as safeguards exist to prevent noncitizen voting and fraudulent voter registration is often a result of misunderstandings or errors."

Federal law rarely dictates who is eligible for specific sports. The claim is also misleading because it implies that Rosen voted to allow biological men to compete in women's sports, which is not accurate.

While some of the evidence suggests that the specific wildfires mentioned may not be directly caused by climate change, other evidence suggests that climate change can contribute to the conditions that make wildfires more likely to occur. For example, a study mentioned in the evidence states that climate change makes the region warmer and the vegetation drier, which can increase the risk of wildfires. Additionally, experts have stated that while natural climate fluctuations have occurred throughout history, the current changes are unrelated to those natural fluctuations and are likely caused by human activities.

The evidence provided shows that the City of Milwaukee's tax levy increased by 12.6% from 2023 to 2024, while Milwaukee Public Schools' tax levy increased by 29.5% during the same period. This suggests that Milwaukee Public Schools' tax levy is indeed larger than the City of Milwaukee's tax levy after the referendum. However, the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that the school district's tax levy is larger than the city's tax levy at all times, which is not supported by the evidence. The data provided by Andrew Reschovsky shows that the school district's tax levy exceeded the city's tax levy only in certain years, not consistently. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

The evidence also shows that Kennedy has not been compensated for vaccine cases, but has been compensated for cases related to the herbicide Roundup and 2018 California wildfires. Additionally, Kennedy's ethics agreement states that he is entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm, but it does not specify that he will receive a percentage of every lawsuit in the future.

However, the claim implies that this is a common practice, which is not entirely accurate. The Trump administration's approach is different from previous uses, as it involves sending people who were detained on U.S. soil to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whereas previously, the migrants were intercepted at sea. Additionally, the administration's plans to detain 30,000 people, which is a significant increase from previous numbers, and the uncertainty surrounding the length of detention and conditions at the facility, suggest that this is not simply a continuation of a long-standing practice.

In fact, the evidence suggests that Biden stepped up immigration enforcement and deported many individuals who entered the country illegally. Additionally, immigrants who arrive illegally have higher hurdles to clear before becoming citizens and voting. The claim is also contradicted by experts, such as David Bier, who stated that Biden never courted the votes of illegal immigrants and that they cannot vote. The claim is likely a political smear and lacks factual basis."

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that 71 out of 72 Wisconsin counties filed lawsuits against Purdue Pharma, which is TRUE. However, the claim also states that Brad Schimel refused to join them, which is partially FALSE. According to the evidence, Schimel did not join the lawsuit as the Attorney General of Wisconsin, but he did work in a bipartisan coalition with other state attorneys general investigating Purdue Pharma. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE because it is partially accurate but also contains an error."

      "**VERDICT**: FALSE\n**REASON**: The claim is based on a single precinct in Rockland County, New York, where Kamala Harris received zero votes. However, the evidence provided does not establish that this is evidence of election hacking by Elon Musk. In fact, the evidence suggests that this is an isolated incident and that the results in the same precinct in previous elections (2020 and 2022) were similar. Additionally, there is no credible evidence of widespread election fraud or hacking in the 2024 presidential election. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misinformation."

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that \"All armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever\" because of Trump policies, and \"it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.\" However, the evidence suggests that the military recruitment results were already improving before Trump took office. The Army's best recruiting month in 15 years was in January, which was before Trump's presidency. Additionally, the Marine Corps Recruiting Command reported that recruiters outperformed the first five months of fiscal year 2025 compared to the same timeframe the previous year, which was before Trump took office. While it is possible that Trump's policies may have had some impact on recruitment, it is not accurate to say that the results were \"exactly the opposite\" just a few months prior. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

      "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is \"polling very well. It's very popular.\" However, the evidence provided shows that the polls are mixed, with some polls showing approval rates ranging from 34% to 45%, while others show disapproval rates ranging from 42% to 54%. Additionally, the evidence suggests that there is concern about DOGE's access to sensitive information and potential conflicts of interest. Overall, the evidence does not support the claim that the Department of Government Efficiency is \"very popular.\""

      "VERDICT: FALSE\nREASON: The claim states that the Trump administration identified $1.9 billion in federal dollars going to a \u201cdecarbonization of homes\u201d group Stacey Abrams \u201cheaded up.\u201d However, the evidence provided does not support this claim. The evidence suggests that the $1.9 billion figure is actually related to a prediction of increased energy expenditures by U.S. households by 2030, not a specific grant or funding allocation to a group headed by Stacey Abrams. Additionally, there is no evidence that Stacey Abrams was involved in a group or committee that received $1.9 billion in federal funding. The claim is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual facts."

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that 31% of U.S. job growth during President Joe Biden's four years in office came from public-sector jobs. However, the evidence suggests that 11% of the job growth came from government jobs, not 31%. The evidence also shows that the federal workforce grew from 2.1 to 3 million under President Joe Biden, which is a 46% increase since Biden took office. This increase is not necessarily equivalent to 31% of U.S. job growth. Therefore, the claim is HALF-TRUE."

      "VERDICT: HALF-TRUE\nREASON: The claim states that the number of full-time jobs has been dropping almost the entire Biden administration. However, the evidence suggests that full-time jobs actually increased during Biden's tenure. While it is true that the number of full-time jobs did not increase as much as part-time jobs, the overall trend is that full-time jobs rose under Biden. The claim is half-true because it is partially accurate, but the emphasis on the negative trend is misleading."
